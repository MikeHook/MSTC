Program was developed to address this problem by offering serious

in a progression, allowing for a steady rate of overload and
adaptation for maximum gains in muscle strength and endurance. The
goal of the endurance athlete is not to 'bulk up' with unwanted
mass, but rather to boost one's muscular capabilities and the
StrEndurance program accomplishes this
goal!</span></span></span></p>

<h2>Non Race Kit - Hoodies &amp; Track Pants</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have recently sourced a local supplier to provide us with
Club hoodies and track pants.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>General Info</strong><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Both the track pants and hoodies come from reliable, ethically
sourced suppliers, which offer quality garments.&nbsp; We have
specifically identified a thicker hoodie perfect for those pre/post
race periods and also great for spectators.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>Prices</strong><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The prices quoted to us will be&nbsp; trade prices based on a
minimum quantity of 20.&nbsp; We are waiting for final quotes, but
It is likely that with front embroidery and a back print (both the
club name and logo) the price will be in the region of £20. The
trackpants with the MSTC name printed down the leg, will also be
priced circa £20.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>Features</strong><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Both items include useful features. The hoodies include thumb
holes in the sleeves, and a hidden iphone pocket,whilst the track
pants include zipped legs for ease of removal over trainers.</p>

those that don't know me I am usually a medium in multisex tops or

<p><img src="~/media/5778/mark-jordan-marmite_200x300.jpg"  width="200"  height="300" alt="mark jordan"/>Mid Sussex Triathlon
Club&nbsp;president Mark Jordan is attempting to complete the
equivalent of two full ironman events in the space of two weeks to
help raise money for the&nbsp;Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p>

<p>"I am going to try to complete a couple of 4 km swims, 100 mile
bike rides and marathons from 8th - 17th April. &nbsp;I will swim
4km on Friday 8th April, cycle 100 miles on Saturday 9th and then
do the Brighton Marathon on 10th April. &nbsp;The following week, I
will swim 4km on 15th, cycle 100 miles on 16th and try to get round
the London Marathon on the 17th.</p>

<p>I am doing them to raise money for the Multiple Sclerosis
Society which we have chosen as our club charity. I wonder please
if you will be so kind - and I know that it is a pain given that
many are 'charitied-out' - help me to raise some money."</p>

<p>If you would like to support Mark and help him raise money for
charity then please visit <a

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Goodwood Duathlon race report from Rachel Baker]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">Goodwood Duathlon race report from
Rachel Baker</p>

<p>On Sunday morning I travelled down to Goodwood to take part in
the Goodwood Duathlon.&nbsp; It was a well organised and small
event which featured two races, a short 4k/24k/4k or long 4k/40k/8k
race.&nbsp; Both races were limited to 100 entries and I was taking
part in the long race.</p>

<p>The race started at 10.00 with the long race competitors going
off five minutes before the short race.&nbsp; I had already warmed
up with a cycle round the 4k track and there was a cross wind which
turned into a head wind as you progressed round the circuit.&nbsp;
Having glanced down the start list prior to the race I was
expecting to see about 6 girls&nbsp;in the race and was hopeful I
might do quite well.&nbsp; Once we were lined up I was surprised
that there were so many ladies in my leg and of course they all
looked a lot faster than me!&nbsp; Bang on 10.00 the race started
and I tried to start at a reasonable speed but without pushing so
hard that I was couldn't put in a good effort on the bike.&nbsp;
This appeared to be a good tactic, I think I was about the 8th lady
into transition and on the first lap round on the bike I had passed
several of the faster runners.&nbsp; I kept pushing hard on the
bike and even though it was on a closed circuit with 10 laps the
small field meant that everyone had plenty of room and it wasn't
hard to keep out of the drafting zone.</p>

<p>The first 8 laps went quite quickly then on the ninth lap I was
caught by a guy who had lost count of his laps and wanted to know
how many I had done.&nbsp; He seemed to think I was one ahead of
him.&nbsp; He seemed to want to have a chat but eventually we both
got our heads down again and I was on the final lap.&nbsp; I tried
not to think my usual thoughts of how difficult it was going to be
when I started to run again but visualised myself effortlessly
running round the track (twice).&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't think
I quite managed that but I did run at a reasonable pace for the
first lap, possibly due to the bottle of water I had in
transition-most of which ended up over my head.&nbsp; The second
lap I started to slow down a bit and by the time I got half way
round I had to make a conscious effort to put some effort in and to
keep my average speed up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it was a final turn off
the track onto the grass run in to the finish.</p>

<p>I decided to wait for the presentations and was very pleased to
find out I was the second lady in the race.</p>

<p>I thought that this was a very well organised event. I really
enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is happy to do a 10
lap bike.&nbsp; It was nice to put my head down and ride and not
have to worry about cars or potholes.</p>

<p dir="ltr" class="Default"><span class="Default__Char">6 athletes
from Mid Sussex Tri Club were up before 5am to get to the start in
time for this very well organised event.</span></p>

<p class="Default">There was still the usual frantic pre-race
adjustments. Both Steve and Rob decided it was a flat enough course
to try racing with disc wheels for the first time ever which meant
a bit of cassette and brake adjustment. James had a new set up
without a disc wheel, but was the only competitor without a timing
chip. Pete decided to throw himself, his bike and a complete
stranger's bike onto the floor for no apparent reason, whilst
dressing up for a deep midwinter race (it was sunny and 15
degrees!). Luckily common sense took over and he stripped off his
thermals, but then also removed his tri-bars (just to give the
other old gits a chance). Ant and Dec, sorry, Dave seemed totally
organised by comparison.</p>

<p class="Default">Ant, Dave and James were off in the second wave
with Rob, Pete and Steve 5 minutes behind. The first run was a
fairly flat and fast 7.5km and it went largely as expected with
James making a flying start. His time of 28.07 was nearly 2 minutes
ahead of Pete who was making a cautious start in 29.54, still very
quick. Then came Steve and Rob in 30.54 and 31.03 respectively,
then Ant (32.29) immediately followed by Dave (32.30).</p>

<p class="Default">All 6 did good fast transitions but king of T1
was Dave in 39 seconds but even the slowest was 67 seconds so very
little time was wasted.</p>

<p class="Default">The bike circuit was an interesting mix of
superb Time Trialling roads, and tight turns at junctions, which
included one point on each lap requiring a complete stop and foot
down before being allowed to continue.</p>

<p class="Default">Not surprisingly it was again James who was
flying with 64.12 for the 40km. Rob soon caught and passed Steve on
his way to a time of 67.51, just a second ahead of Dave 67.52. Ant
was about a minute down with 69.00. Steve was surprised to reel in
Pete on the bike, until he realised that Pete was not using
tri-bars which would have made a huge difference. Steve did 69.49
and Pete 71.30.</p>

<p class="Default">T2 was another speedy affair. Even the slowest
time was only 57 seconds but king of T2 was Steve in 39 seconds
although Dave was again very quick, just a second behind, which
makes him overall transition king this time!</p>

<p class="Default"><span class="Default__Char">The second run was
the same as the first, but then the flat run suddenly didn't seem
so flat. It was also now quite a lot warmer. Steve was delighted to
find that he was the fastest on the second run with 31.23, less
than 30 seconds slower than the first run, largely due to seeing
Rob ahead and having someone to aim at. As usual he only overtook
with 800m to go with Rob struggling with cramp. James' second run
was only 3 seconds slower than Steve - 31.26, with Pete slightly
behind in 31.33. Rob did 33.18, Ant 34.48 and Dave
35.19.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" class="Default"><span class="Default__Char">Overall
James was well clear of everyone else, finishing some 8 minutes
clear of Steve in the end&nbsp; who was 27 seconds ahead of Rob.
Pete finished another minute down, then Dave 2 minutes behind and
Ant about a further minute down.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" class="Default"><span class="Default__Char">This was a
great first race of the season, which was a World Duathlon
Championship qualifier. We must now wait to see if any of us have
actually qualified.</span></p>

<span>Wonderful weather greeted us as we began our first Southwater
&nbsp;swim of 2011. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
 Tim and Clare, Jules, Rose, Trevor, Sharon, Rachel, Steve Mac and
Kay all arrived in nervous anticipation of their first open water
lake swim of the year.<br />
<br />
 All agreed it was a lot warmer than expected. The warm evening
sunshine still offering a 21 degree air temp and the clear, algae
free water made for a wonderfully refreshing swim after the
confines of the pool throughout winter.<br />
<br />
 We look forward to seeing other club members next Monday.

the challenge involved a 4km swim on Friday
8</span></span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>
<span>April, a 100 mile bike ride on Saturday 9<sup>th</sup>

on</span> <span>Friday 15<sup>th</sup> <span>&nbsp;</span> April,
100</span> <span>mile bike ride on Saturday 16<sup>th</sup>
<span>&nbsp;</span> and the London Marathon on the
17<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; I am well aware that this was by no means a
unique series and especially given that a significant number of
people have done multiple back-to-back full Ironmans.&nbsp; It was
though, something of a challenge to me, even in the conception of
it and as my body will testify, in the completion of it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal"><span>I started the first swim at just before 0700
with what Dave Jones describes as 'my waddle' up the first of 160
lengths of the 25-metre pool.&nbsp; I was aiming to complete in a
time of 80 minutes or so and thus tried to maintain a steady 30
seconds a length.&nbsp; I tried to concentrate on tempo and style -
something that I insist others do when we train.&nbsp; Requiring it
is one thing, doing it is another.&nbsp; I found it quite difficult
at first to achieve any kind of rhythm, let alone tempo, with the
constant turning.&nbsp; It did start to come after about 300 metres
and, thereafter, I managed to keep a good, steady, even pace.&nbsp;
I quickly lost count of the numbers of lengths and relied on Lizzie
showing me a countdown board.&nbsp; I finished in little over 76
minutes.&nbsp; It was a little quicker than I wanted but I must
say, I really enjoyed the whole thing.&nbsp; It was a great
training session.</span></p>

class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal"><span>The first ride the following day was an
experience I will not forget.&nbsp; It was not that it was my first
ever 100-mile ride but that so many people had organised themselves
into groups to cycle around the various laps of the course with
me.&nbsp; I was really moved by the enthusiasm and
commitment.&nbsp; I had devised a route that took in 3 laps that
took us from my house through Ditchling, along the bottom of
the</span> <span>Downs</span> <span>to Cooksbridge, up the A275 to
Chelwood Gate, then to Horsted Keynes and back through Cockhaise to
my house.&nbsp; I intended to try to cycle at somewhere between 14
and 15 mph and so finish in a little under 7 hours.&nbsp; The
weather was superb and just got better.&nbsp; We ticked along,
chatting about everything under the sun.&nbsp; We maintained the
hope for pace on the first lap, slowed a little on the second and
picked it up on the third.&nbsp; The last bit of the third lap was
bit of a mess.&nbsp; My bike computer was only intermittently
picking up the mileage.&nbsp; I got it into my mind, and I know it
was stupid, that the computer had to show 100 miles plus before I
could finish.&nbsp; Trevor Moore was with me (Steve Mac' had had to
branch off earlier because he was running out of time).&nbsp; He
and I ended up pedalling up and down</span> <span>Gravelye
Lane</span> <span>until my computer tripped over the 100-mile
mark.&nbsp; Goodness knows how far we actually did but Trevor is a
patient man.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal"><span>The Brighton Marathon was an experience and a
half.&nbsp; I am by no means a runner and, despite the
ministrations of Paul Wills, I was not looking forward to it.&nbsp;
I set out at a steady pace aiming to get somewhere around the 4
hour mark.&nbsp; The weather was splendid, if a bit too hot.&nbsp;
The event itself was absolutely fantastic.&nbsp; The support was
incredible.&nbsp; The spectators were 3 or 4 deep from the very
start through to the end.&nbsp; We really do have a marathon to be
proud of.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my performance did not match the
quality of the event.&nbsp; Someone switched my energy supply off
at 20 miles, just as we got into the dreaded</span>
<span>Shoreham</span> <span>Harbour</span><span>, the one place
where there was little spectator support.&nbsp; I went from just
under 9 minute miles to walking in a matter of metres.&nbsp;
Thankfully, Steve Birchall came passed at about 21 miles.&nbsp; He
stopped and then helped me to the end.&nbsp; I was in tatters for
the last 3 miles.&nbsp; Steve managed to coax me over the line in 4
hours 5 minutes and 51 seconds.&nbsp; I then proceeded to nose dive
into the concrete just after the finish, making a complete and
utter idiot of myself.&nbsp; After a dowsing in the sea (in lieu of
an ice bath) I then gave back all of the Poweraid that the
organisers had kindly given out on the run.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I
gave it back without the bottles.&nbsp; My mood was not helped by a
number of horrid blisters, one of which was somewhat deep and
across the bottom of my right foot.&nbsp; I was none too keen to
think about what was coming up the following week.&nbsp; I was
disappointed with the time and with my inability to stand up to the
physical challenge.&nbsp; It was quite a low time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal"><span>The next week seems to be a bit of a
blur.&nbsp; I kept to the regime that Paul Wills had set me and was
able to sit in the cold baths for 10 minutes without expending my
entire repertoire of expletives. I enjoyed the London Marathon
registration because of the buzz and the opportunity to go to the
exhibition.&nbsp; I left there on the Wednesday afternoon actually
looking forward to what was to come.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal"><span>The swim on the 15<sup>th</sup> went
well.&nbsp; I stuck to a steadier pace and felt comfortable
completing the 4kms in 78 minutes and 2 seconds.&nbsp; The ride the
next day was okay too.&nbsp; Once again a host of people came out
even though a good number were racing the next day in</span>
<span>Cambridge</span> <span>at the qualifying race for the
European Duathlon Champs or in the 25 miles time trial.&nbsp; We
ticked along at a slightly quicker pace, chatting the whole way and
setting the world to rights.&nbsp; We altered the course slightly
to get off the A275.&nbsp; It seems that the sun brings out the
worst in motorists.&nbsp; Some cannot evidently comprehend that
cyclists have as much right to be on the roads as they
have.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal"><span>Oddly enough, I was looking forward to the
London Marathon.&nbsp; I haven't done it since 1989.&nbsp; I was
like a little boy waiting for Christmas.&nbsp; Gone were the
dreadful thoughts at the end of</span>
<span>Brighton</span><span>.&nbsp; David Rickets and his wife
kindly took me up to the start.&nbsp; David was really great in
looking after me and certainly through the first 13 miles.&nbsp; My
plan was to run on heart rate at 9 minute-mile pace for the first
half and to see what happened thereafter.&nbsp; Everything went to
plan, although David and I got separated at about 14 miles.&nbsp; I
felt pretty good physically and so just kept going on heart
rate.&nbsp; I got tired when I saw the 26-mile marker.&nbsp; For
some reason, my brain decided that that indicated the end and I
spent a little while trying to persuade myself that there was .2 of
a mile left to go.&nbsp; I finished in 3 hours 53 minutes and 13
seconds.&nbsp; It might have been a relatively slow time but I must
confess to having been chuffed to bits.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"
class="normal"><span class="normalchar"><span>I have thought quite
a lot about the experience.&nbsp; I set out to do it for a number
of reasons: to raise money for the</span></span> <span>club
charity, to give myself a challenge, to get into the routine of a
reasoned training plan and to lose some weight.&nbsp; I have
achieved those goals.&nbsp; I enjoyed the whole experience.&nbsp; I
also learned a great deal.&nbsp; At the risk of sounding
sanctimonious, there are two things that stand out for me: (1) the
mind is something with considerable potential but all too often I
have allowed mine to be a limiter in terms of what I might be able
to achieve and (2) my body can withstand far more than I have given
it credit for.</span></p>

have a quick swim sprint to remind me why I am here. Back to the
start for a deep water start whistle goes and it's a very civilised
affair no kicks or punches. this is not open water swimming.. after
about 100m it feels like the wheels are about to come off "What the
hell" I thought "this isn't right" is it the wetsuit? I have only
warn it twice!!! <span></span> 400m suddenly everything is fine,
that was weird, now to catch the lead pack that I foolishly let get
away. 13:26 out of the water in 7<sup>th</sup> place</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Next panic
I could not get the wetsuit off very strange, then to top it off I
slipped over not quite to Pete Harris's standard but still both
feet up in the air. I take the opportunity and get the rest of the
suit off honest I meant to do it like that.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I feel 5
years old again. I cant tie my shoe laces, I am breathing heavy and
trying to slow my heart rate down but cant get the laces done, I
cursed the decision not to wear the elastic laced trainers, cobbled
a knot together and set off on the run a just over a minute
later.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>O my god
what happened to my lungs!!!! Unlike going out on the bike where
you get a chance to get a breath straight out on the run you don't,
I'm currently 7<sup>th</sup> and want it to stay that
way.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Dam lace is
undone. stop tie it up better this time.. Dam lace is undone. stop
tie it up and get passed. <span></span> ##@# undone again are you
kidding me, its knotted now.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>At the run
turn around just got passed like I was standing still and I am in
9<sup>th.</sup> there is a guy behind me I can hear him, I'm doing
a 07:30 pace but he is still there and I cant see the finish line,
he passes me so I tuck in behind him, he's not getting away,
there's the finish should I go now and risk him beating me on a
return sprint? Yep go for it, 3 long strides and he's behind a few
more to hold him off a few more and he has given up and I am over
the line 23:15.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>Everybody dashed off from the start as expected, there
were some under 30 minutes times.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>Couldn't stay on good feet, just swum on my own. Hence
the slow time, 36.15.</span></span> <span><span>It was still a
comfortable, pleasant swim.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>I
need some work on transitions, for sure. This was my first
tri,&nbsp; 6.15 and 6.52 still seems very slow.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>I
felt soooo organised. The only glitch was I forgot to remove the
rain coat from my cycling top,</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>run
back when realized it was bouncing too
much.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>There
really wasn't too much distance to cover, it was all
me.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Heavy
rain was the forecast but it was dry and ideal conditions if a bit
windy. I guess it's the location.</span></span></p>

<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Bike
was uneventful and pancake flat. There were only signs if the route
went off the main road,</span></span> <span><span>I felt bad
because of it several times but didn't go astray.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>3.32
is actually a good time for me, I'm so weak on the
bike.</span></span> <span><span>Can't even put my bottle back
without stopping and putting the feet actually down though&nbsp;I'm
practicing this a lot.</span></span> <span><span>Fast course, ideal
for tri bars, which I've got but can't use, it feels so unsafe for
me.</span></span> <span><span>It still holds one of my bottle, very
useful, see above.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
run was on a nice course, very bad signage here. I think it was a
problem even last year,</span></span> <span><span>I can't
understand how could they not fix this. The event is in it's third
year, btw.</span></span> <span><span>Actually run through two
marshalls busy talking, then realized a minute later I've gone
astray,</span></span> <span><span>turned back, asked them which
way, also why didn't they told me earlier.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>They
told me they haven't thought I was in the race.
Huhhh.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>2.29
was what I expected. 6.50.44 overall, not dead last but very
close.</span></span></p>

<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>I've
only had two short runs in&nbsp;the last month, and around 20 runs
overall in this year.</span></span> <span><span>This included a
half, a 20miler and a full, the rest were short
runs/bricks.</span></span> <span><span>You can't run much better
than you've trained for.</span></span></p>

<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Last
year I've run much more, this year I've injured my knee several
times from cycling with too low cadence.</span></span>

my IM in July, let's hope not too late...</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Had a

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[An impressive 15 MSTC athletes had entered this race, which I think is a club record for a TT. I think more of us are realising just how useful Time Trialling is in creating triathlon bike speed. ]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Unfortunately only 13 started with Pete Harris worried to test
out his new TT steed in wet and windy conditions, whilst Mark
Jordan proved that it is just as dangerous doing a training ride.
He cycled into a stationary car, fortunately quite slowly, and no
significant injuries.</p>

<p>Due to recent roadworks on the original course we were riding a
modified course, with the start some 5 miles away. This caught out
Trevor who missed his start time by 2 ½ minutes, but was nothing to
Colin Chambers who got to the start early then wandered off
aimlessly, thus joining Ant Grey in that specialist sport - the
Time Trial for people with no sense of direction. He eventually
found his way back over 20 minutes late! Mind you, he also missed
his start last year!</p>

<p>It was a wet and windy day but both James dear and Rupert
Robinson were comfortably under the hour, with James taking the win
by just 4 seconds!</p>

<p>3 minutes down was Rob Hoodless in 62.26, with the ever
improving Dave Lashbrook with his second PB over 25 miles in as
many weeks, just 16 seconds behind in 62.42. Ant Grey also had a
very strong ride to finish in 64.03 and Colin (I haven't been on my
bike all winter) Chambers did his now expected 65.43 and Steve (I
have trained quite hard and this is probably as fast as I can do)
Alden managing 67.11</p>

<p>One of the strongest rides of the day came from Rachel Baker as
she also lowered her PB to 69.27, comfortably ahead of Steve (I
shouldn't have ridden so far last week)Mac in 71.02, although I
heard a rumour that these long rides were called training, which
ultimately will result in more speed!</p>

<p>Martin Sanwell also earned himself a PB with 73.00 but is sure
to better this once he gets his new bike on the road. Trevor
managed to get over his late start and also rode a PB&nbsp; in
76.01, closely followed by Hazel Tuppen in 77.07 in another PB.</p>

<p>Rose Ryan may have been the last home in 95.56, but she entered
it, worked hard all the way round and earned a PB. This is the true
essence of Time Trialling, that you are racing against yourself,
and to my mind, Rose earned the 'spirit of the race' award for her
efforts.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>At the end of April, Steve Mac, Ian Anderson,
Brad Williams and Kev James headed out for two day epic to the Isle
of Wight and back.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>It started with a rendezvous at the dolphin pub
at 8.30 then onto Hurst to pick up Steve by 9am. By the time we had
left Steve's we now we all had our tales of lack of training and
lack of miles all on record, so it was time for some hard
graft.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>We ditched the original plan to keep to the A272
on the insistence of Ian and were treated to a better ride as a
result. The first part of the ride picked up the Sunday steyning
run in reverse but we cut across via Spithandle lane to Washington
then onto Storrington before hitting the country lanes
properly.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>The roads were fairly rough in places with a few
lumps but nothing too strenuous but we were enjoying the chance to
ride side by side and slowly eating up the miles with a helpful
tailwind. <span></span> With a few map checks we risked a road
closed to road works and came across a stunning scene of a lake and
open woodland. We all agreed that we'd be moving to the house
overlooking the lake.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Much too our amusement at the next map check Brad
seemed so overwhelmed by the name of the village (Cocking) that he
had the first (and not last) wobble of the trip, We agreed to
briefly picked up the A272 through Midhurst before heading south
again to Elsted. <span></span> The first killer climb of the day
was realised at Harting.I think this features in the Chichester
triathlon and at one point I was close to track standing I was
going so slow. Ian was in turbo charged mode with Brad glued to his
wheel. I only had the comfort that Steve was behind grinding it
out. We topped out on the climb and had a fast decent heading south
before we cut west again up another sharp
climb.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>With around 60 miles done, by now we were all
thinking about food and in the small village of Chalton, we stopped
at the excellent Red Lion pub, which had amazing views overlooking
a valley of the Hampshire downs. The sun was shining brightly and
we had a very leisurely lunch, with Brad seeming to fall asleep on
a park bench at some point. <span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>With stiff legs and full bellies we set off. And
in classic form we were straight up another sharp hill which we
could have anticipated having enjoyed the view of the said hill
over lunch. Steve was having gear problems as well as feeling the
effects of his meal. Up this hill we then bridged the A3 and then
hit the Meon valley. <span></span> I had never ridden this part of
Hampshire before and it was a definite highlight. Virtually flat
and with sweeping bends and a tailwind, I couldn't resist hitting
the front and trying to up the pace. While this stretch was quite
long, it was over far too soon.
<span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Having treated ourselves to fast and flat roads,
we decided it was time for some off-road fun. We had spotted a lane
that looked quite small on the map but we thought it might be
rideable - well kind of. Luckily we all managed to stay upright and
puncture free and I enjoyed a few cyclo cross style moves over tree
stumps and avoiding large rocks. My overconfidence was sharply
brought back into balance as the back-end stepped out just as I hit
the gravel as the track transitioned to rough road - but I managed
to hold it together.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>We had a few more map checks to do before we
managed to pick up some of the road section fairly near the end of
the South Downs Way. Having done this ride in reverse a few times I
remembered a few landmarks and realised we would have a long drag
up onto the downs again. <span></span> We topped out the climb
surrounded by open fields of rape in glorious sunshine and headed
West again to Twyford, crossing the M3 just south of
there.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>We were starting to realise that time was ticking
on. Luckily I had found my legs a bit more after struggling most of
the early morning. We pushed it on a bit via busier roads and found
the Hampshire drivers were not cycling fans. Admittedly, in a break
neck run through Romsey, just north of the New Forest, Ian decided
to test the breaks of a car turning right on a roundabout, which
meant that we weren't complete angel cyclists. I had no choice but
to keep going having been glued to Ian's wheel but had to flick the
bike at speed and I was amazed that Brad - behind me - also opted
for the same option. Steve had the sense and foresight to see that
stopping was a better option. A bit too close for my
comfort.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>From therein we were keeping a reasonable pace,
but were not too sure if it was going to be close for the ferry.
<span></span> It was at this point that the 100 mile mark started
to bite us all. <span></span> Steve had a brief moment on his own
but as the road went up he somehow saw the end crawling slowly
towards him and stopped the elastic snapping. I can't say that the
New Forest was much of a highight as the roads were heavy with
stressed out bank holiday drivers. And mysteriously, a long grind
up through the Forest was not rewarded with a decent into Lymington
- how does that work hill and sea level anyone?. Still we were
happy to make it to the ferry with a ½ hour to
spare.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>The ferry crossing was enjoyed with a strong
coffee and a bit of chat, but it was amazingly short and we all
lowered ourselves gingerly onto our bikes in Yarmouth in the Isle
of Wight. Fortunately, we were still blessed with sunshine and the
stand-out point was how quiet the roads were. A stark contrast to
the New Forest. <span></span> The road to where we were staying in
Newport was rolling but not especially testing and we had a chance
to ride two-abreast without too many traffic issues and soon made
up the final few miles. With relief found the Travelodge we were
staying at with 120 miles in the legs. The evening was then a story
of a mega nosh up in a local Italian and the treat of a few ice
cold lagers.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Day 2 -
Isle of Wight and back again</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>The second day didn't start as brightly and we
were all fairly saddle sore even sitting down for breakfast. Steve
managed to use his charms to get us a breakfast deal of tea and
toast to which we seem to add a number of other breakfast
extras.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>A very brief ride down the street was halted by
Ian noticing a flat-ish tyre. In the waiting period Brad seemed to
get a bit bored. Having remained cleated-in on one side he decided
it was time for the second wobble of the trip. Again much to my
amusement.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>I think that I made a bit too much of the
breakfast as I suffered in the first hour of the ride. We decided
in the time available to make our way down to the Needles to do the
sight seeing thing. This entailed riding up and over a series of
long hills and topping out on what might have been the high point
of Island. <span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>We headed into Freshwater then took a bit of a
detour around the coast to the north. I must admit at this point
that I was feeling groggy from the beers the day before and tired
and was not particularly enjoying myself, so the prospect of hills
up and over the Needles was not welcome. We eventually found our
way to the Needles and took a small single track road into the face
of a mental head wind that had us all in the small chainring. At
the top we still couldn't see the Needles, but we watched the
alarming sight of Ian descending offroad towards the cliff's edge.
Ian was apparently quite confident that his brakes were quite good.
We had visions of air-sea rescue.
<span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Photo opportunity in the bag we headed back to
the Needles visitor centre where I had to change a puncture. While
waiting, Brad spent time looking in the gift shop, but was heart
broken that the sand in test tubes was no longer available in the
gift shop, clearly this had left a lasting impression on
him!</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Once again we were concerned about the time of
the ferry and the distances we had to cover. The slow progress in
the morning was only going to get worse as we now had a strong
westerly headwind to deal with. On this basis, we headed back on
the main road (hardly busy) and ate up the miles with Ian on the
front and the rest of us sitting in. Fortunately, we all stuck
together so it was fairly fast going and we got through Yarmouth
again to see a load of cyclist starting an Isle of Wight sportive
event. <span></span> We made the ferry in Fishbourne with time to
spare and just missed the earlier Ferry by a few
minutes.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Across the sea we were soon rolling out of
Portsmouth, which was not the nicest welcome back to the mainland.
Busy roads and head winds were the order of the day. These miles
passed without much excitement. Ian was happy to be on the front,
which he had been most of the day, reinforcing his nickname of "The
Ox" even more. We eventually picked up another rider coming out of
Havant towards Chichester. He was kind enough to show us the way
around Chichester and past Goodwood House. <span></span> We left
him to head back South, and agreed to do a brief stint on the A27
so that we could pick up the Slindon valley. Once again I was
feeling much better at the 60 mile point (the same as the day
before), so I led us up the climb up the valley (although Brad was
happy to sprint for the last 50 metres at the
top!!).</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>The reward at the top of the valley was the ride
down into Amberley at good speed then the three hills that step up
towards Storrington. We all stopped at the garage for the final
energy and water refills. As always the road from Storrington
towards Steyning and back home via Ashbourne was pretty kind to us.
We managed to keep it together most of the time and we were all
pleased that we had enough in the legs to keep it going to Steve's.
It was there that we bid adieu and then the final short leg up
Isaac's lane with 220 miles + logged.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Overall, it was a great trip with everyone at a
similar level in terms of fitness and everyone in good spirits. The
beers in the evening were a welcome treat as was getting off the
saddle after some mega miles (both Steve and I found that it was a
good two days before we could sit properly again!) It also worked
out pretty cheap - £50 for the accommodation and ferry - and we
agreed that it would be a good ride to try to repeat in future.

<p>BAR&nbsp; Race 3 EG Tri Sunday May 15th 2011</p>

<p>An incredible 45 MSTC athletes took part in the East Grinstead
sprint Triathlon on Sunday. Over 370 took part in the race and we
finished with 12 athletes in the top 50. That is an almost
unbelievable achievement.</p>

<p>It was great to welcome back David Ricketts, James Duddy and
Callum into the world of racing after lengthy times out of
competition. Each had doubts about their fitness but acquitted
themselves very well, and we hope to see them racing regularly
now.</p>

<p>We did have the usual 'sicknote' brigade claiming all sorts of
injuries before they started, from David's popping calf, to Loz and
his neck.</p>

<p>It was certainly interesting having an MSTC specific start. I
don't think there were any particular issues with the swim although
there may have been the odd length counting mistake which helped
one or two! Loz did struggle a bit with his neck problem but gamely
persevered.</p>

<p>The main problems were encountered on the bike leg. Ant Grey was
bemoaning a rear mech problem which limited gear selection, but he
was still pretty quick. He also misunderstood how you qualify for
an ARSE award, and was seen groping Ian O's backside as he rode
past!<br />
Angela Murray had to stop when her chain came off but she stopped,
fixed it and had barely any oil on her hands, with a slick(!)
recovery. David Ricketts tried to ride into the back of Rachel in
the Forest Row snarl ups, although Rachel's modified 'Ann Summers'
trisuit may have been a contributory factor that distracted him!
Further on Rachel got into quite a battle with Steve Mac as he
desperately tried to avoid being chicked. In the end he resorted to
the underhand tactic of a dodgy roundabout manoeuvre, to get into
T2 ahead (although Rachel's bike split was still faster).</p>

<p>The main problem on the bike leg was the traffic. Loz thought he
could get an edge on everyone by starting early, but found that
this coincided with tractor traffic. Was this the same tractor that
caused mayhem for the later starters, I wonder? He also had a chain
issue, so had to go and overtake the same people all over again.
Several riders got caught in the bottleneck that is Forest Row,
many were held up by the ambulance following the earlier incident
(rumour has it that a pedestrian stepped out in front of a
cyclist), many were blocked at the chicane at the entrance to
Hartfield. Some were held up by all of the above and Sunday drivers
and red lights. Steve Mac got the better of the tractor by leaping
onto the pavement and undertaking successfully, but had plenty of
hold ups to make up for it. It is fair to say that this time it was
quite a frustrating bike leg, although Rupert seemed to enjoy it,
with the general lumpiness suiting his strength on the bike. Sharon
enjoyed a moment of glory when she left Steve Birchall in her wake,
then realised he was just messing about with his shoes, and he came
storming past again.<br />
Everyone felt sorry for poor Fiona in her first Tri, when she
punctured early on the bike and was brought back by the sweep
van.</p>

<p>The new run course was about 2 minutes longer than last year,
but is still quite a quick route. A few of the faster athletes got
caught out by the cunningly hidden low wall behind a tree on the
dogleg, and Kev had to take split second evasive action. The most
fun was had around transition when everyone came in at the end of
Lap 1. There were different arrows for everything and it is amazing
that only 2 managed to go wrong. David tried to finish a lap early
and actually crossed the finish line before turning round and
heading off again, looking a bit disorientated, although whenever
David is near a transition he does look a bit like this, and Trevor
tried to make up for it by attempting to start a 3rd lap before
realising his error and trying to cross the barricades.</p>

<p><br />
I have not reported on individual times as there is just too much
information, but I will comment on Dave Jones' awesome run split of
17m33s only bettered by the first 3 in the race, which allowed him
to take the MSTC crown,and James Dear's bike split which was 5th
fastest overall.&nbsp; Also well done to Pete Harris with his 2nd
place in the V50 men. The ladies race was comfortably won by Rachel
from Sam. I think the general consensus was in spite of the traffic
problems it was a great day for the club. Jean summed it up by
saying it was an event she enjoyed all the way round, and several
people commented on how good the marshals were especially on the
run route. Clare even jetted in from warmer climes just to make
sure she didn't miss out.</p>

<p>And finally, in the race of the day, with Ian 'bigging up' his
athletic ability over Steve Mac, all eyes were on them. It was
certainly a very close race with Steve only just narrowly winning
by 10 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>**Update:</strong></p>

<p>Report from EG's safety officer:</p>

<p><br />
The incident took place in Forest Row on the Hartfield Road just
after the double roundabout as the road passes a parade of shops on
each side of the street. A member of the general public stepped off
the pavement to walk across the road and into the path of one of
our competitors. Unfortunately, she is an elderly lady and was
considerably shaken having come into contact with the competitor
and falling to the ground. The competitor received cuts and grazes
and no doubt bruises. The emergency services were called to the
scene and the lady was taken to hospital, the competitor and his
bicycle were recovered to East Grinstead Leisure Centre by members
of EG Tri club.</p>

<p>We will be following up the incident with the police to find out
how the lady who was taken to hospital is getting on. The
competitor returned home unaided.</p>

<span></span> I was about a minute slower than expected but I did
find some feet to draft off so that helped, apparently the current

cows and horses to keep you alert. Uneventful ride except being
distracted by the foals playing and having to slalom my way through
a herd of cows which was fun.</span></span></p>

continue to rain and that there were some bright skies later on
that its good to still be friends.... which is asking a lot when it
was a 3 'clock start to the day, a power nap of ten minutes in the
car after a quick drop off of bike in the wet dark un lit
transition. The race itself went well'ish I made lots of silly
mistakes that included getting lost as we racked up in the dark and
then i ran the wrong way out of T2 and had to run down the hill and
back up. I did a pb of 37 minutes - but it was a battle of being
very tired after the sprint the week before and an Olympic with two
week training camp at club la Santa... anyway its all done and
dusted and now i only have to panic about the IM in 6
weeks.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Saturday 21st May, Bintan Island Indonesia (Olympic
Distance Triathlon)</strong></p>

<p>Having hung around in the heat, 38c and the humidity 93%, for
nearly four hours,&nbsp;I was almost looking forward to the start
at 14.00hrs. This was going to be my&nbsp;first triathlon abroad
and my first sea swim tri. So you can imagine I was feeling a
little nervous.</p>

<p>About an hour before the start I had to sit in a chair on the
beach and get my arms stamped with the race number, that made me
look quite professional! Lining up on the sands waiting for the
start was amazing, just being there with all the different
nationalities. Then we were off racing across the sand to enter the
water, very different to a lake start!!</p>

<p>The water temperature was 29c and very salty!! Running through
the water eventually it came up to my neck, I then realised that
this was the swim leg not the run leg!! Once I got into my rhythm I
was fine, I was even out swimming the jelly fish and&nbsp;the
sharks!! The swim course was two laps, so we had to run out of the
water around a marker on the beach and back into the water. No
problems on the second lap except that as I got nearer to the beach
I went to stand up and the water only just reached my knees!!!
Didn't want to be accused of the not swimming the full
distance!!!!</p>

<p>I was in and out of T1 in 1min 22sec and out on the one lap bike
course which was very undulating on wide smooth roads. I was flying
on the bike and managed to overtake loads of people, making up for
the time lost on the swim!! No problems on the bike and I made sure
I was drinking plenty as the temperature was rising.</p>

<p>In and out of T2 in 1 min 3 sec and on to the two laps run
course which was on and off road and very undulating. I was feeling
good coming off the bike and soon got into my stride. Although it
was extremely hot luckily there were drink stations every 2K which
had isotonic drink, water and cold sponges!!! With lap one out the
way I managed to pick the pace up a bit overtaking a number of
other runners and before I knew it I was sprinting down the finish
chute!!!</p>

<p>What a fantastic experience and a great setting matched only by
my lovely daughter and her husband cheering me on!!</p>

<p>With a lot of other races going on we were not expecting a large
contingent from MSTC for a 100m Time Trial. Loz Wintergold and Dave
Lashbrook entered but unfortunately Loz was struck down with a
tummy bug that resulted in significantly more running than cycling.
This left the door open for Dave for a stress free uncontested ride
to 10 BAR points.</p>

<p>However Dave still had the small matter of attempting a PB over
this distance but it was not going to be easy. This course can be
quick, but today it was windy which made it very tricky.</p>

<p>In 2008, Dave did 4hr35m26s, and I know he was round about 4h
35s this time but I have not heard his final time yet. Clearly it
is going to be close. Fingers crossed! (Just for the record Dave
then beat his 10m TT PB on Thursday evening in 23m51s. Well
done!)</p>

<p>Mind you the winner did 3h38m46s - a truly astonishing time -
and about 5 minutes inside the course record.</p>

<p>Winner: 3h38m46s</p>

<p>Dave Lashbrook:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4h 35m
approx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 points</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>We had 13 entries from the club, but Dave Lashbrook and Sam
Anderson did not race, leaving 11 hardy swimmers on the start line.
This is an interesting swim as it in salt water even though it
starts 2.5 miles inland. It is timed to start with the high tide so
by the time you reach the finish you are swimming with the current.
Theoretically this could be the case all the way along but it
certainly doesn't feel it.</p>

<p>There were about 250 swimmers on the start line, and when that
klaxon goes the water just turns to froth as everyone scrabbles for
room. There is bumping, kicking, elbowing, and occasional swimming
in the melee that is the first 800m. Then suddenly it all settles
down and as far as I can say, is just plain boring for the next 2k
as you just concentrate on keeping the effort up. Nature did its
bit to keep it more interesting as a headwind in some parts of the
river made it very choppy, resulting in many unexpected mouthfuls
of sea water. At least that reduced the risk of cramp with a steady
salt intake. It was a relief to see the A259 road bridge as Steve
Mac had told us that meant 1200m to go and time to ramp up to the
finish. When we passed the Ropewalk Bridge he had warned us there
was just 400m to go, and we were now in the strongest current. We
all felt like Olympic athletes as one good pull seemed to propel
you&nbsp;5 metres downstream.</p>

<p>Steve Mac was easily the strongest swimmer of us without Dave
racing and he did not disappoint with a very strong swim finishing
in 57m25s and 33rd overall. Steve Alden was 2nd home over 5 minutes
behind (62.54), with Andy Jenkins just over a minute behind
(64.18).</p>

<p>John Liebers treated it as a gentle limber up before his double
Ironman attempt next Saturday and cruised home in 68.35 - some 6
minutes faster than last year. (Good luck next week, John).</p>

<p>Pete Harris showed that his swimming has improved massively as
he surprised himself with a 69.37, just seconds ahead of Jeff
Woodall (69.44) and Trevor Moore (70.21). Trevor was also delighted
to get 4 BAR points! He also beat last year's time by 7 minutes.
Excellent! Pete and Jeff have not done this sort of distance before
so this was an amazing achievement.</p>

<p>Katie Walch led home the ladies with 64.52, but had only got
back from Hungary the day before and had lost a couple of weeks of
training.</p>

<p>Claire Cresswell showed that her Lanzarote training camp had
really paid off with a strong 70.43 swim, which hopefully will
improve her confidence as she heads towards her Ironman
attempt.</p>

<p>Jules was rightly delighted with her swim, nearly 13 minutes
faster than last year, in probably harder conditions to finish in
73.29, one place and just 13 seconds ahead of Sharon Chladek in
73.43. This was Sharon's first attempt at this sort of distance and
open water, so was a superb effort.</p>

<p>One final mention goes to all the family support crews who came
along. Some followed the race all the way down the river bank! It
was a beautiful day and I think they all enjoyed it.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Ardingly Triathlon Race Report - 5 June 2011</p>

<p>The reincarnated Ardingly Triathlon, revived by Paul Hedger's
Hedgehog Tri after a one-year break, was not on the BAR list this
year, but with 12 MSTC athletes competing surely deserves a race
report.</p>

<p>Five MSTC athletes - James Dear, Ant Grey, Andy Heath, David
Ricketts and Callum Murray - were enticed to compete by the offer
of a free place in the race in exchange for counting lengths in the
pool, an experience that generated a new respect for those that do
the tricky job of counting the lengths of four swimmers
simultaneously, while remembering to stick the '2 lengths to go'
paddle in the water at the right time for each swimmer.</p>

<p>Two others, Angela Murray and Rachel Baker, counted lengths but
didn't compete, contributing to the good relations we are building
up with Paul, who will play an important role at the Go Tri!
Juniors event we are running on July 30 and 31.&nbsp; Many thanks
to them.</p>

<p>For those doing both, as James Dear said, it was a case of
getting your counting head on first, followed by your race head,
and not mixing up the two.&nbsp; James, needless to say, had no
such problems, coming second in the race overall in 1.08.50, with a
magnificent bike split of 40.36, considering that the long drag up
to Turners Hill - hard going at the best of times - was into the
teeth of a strong headwind.</p>

<p>Performance of the day probably has to go to Ant Grey, though,
who was 13th in 1.16.31, with strong showings in all three
disciplines.&nbsp; With a five lap run course up and down the hill
on the college playing fields, I got plenty of chances to see him
gradually closing the gap between us as he came round each
time.</p>

<p>Also proving himself to be a strong all-rounder was Martin
Sanwell in 32nd position, while Andy Heath's strong swim split of
08.19 drove him into 46th position.</p>

<p>Other notable performances came from: Trevor Moore, who was
competing the day after completing the Arun River Swim; Stuart
Anderson, with a welcome reappearance in club colours after
concentrating more on cycling recently; Paul Wills, who's
definitely getting the hang of this triathlon game; David Ricketts
who continued his long-awaited triathlon comeback; Tim Cresswell
who was reduced to a walk at one stage on the tough run course but
still gamely finished in a decent time; Jean Fish, who threw her
leaky goggles away in disgust as she emerged from the pool (don't
worry Jean, I rescued them, and will return them when I next see
you), but vented her fury on the bike course with a storming split;
and Rose Ryan, whose delight at getting another triathlon under her
belt warmed the heart.</p>

<p>As at East Grinstead, it felt like MSTC 'owned' the finish line,
as our athletes gathered to cheer home each of our finishers.&nbsp;
Great shouting guys!</p>

<p>Oh, and perhaps I could just mention that I scored an Ardingly
Triathlon PB and have been on a high ever since.</p>

<p>MSTC athletes' results below.&nbsp; There were 149 finishers in
the race in total.&nbsp; For the full results, follow this link: <a

<p><strong>Double Enduroman (New Forest) - 11 &amp; 12 June

<p>Two members of the club&nbsp;John Liebers and newbie Jim Graham
have just completed the Enduroman double IronMan event in the New

time as the Deca Ironman event. Here are both their outstanding

class="MsoNormal"><span>The Enduroman Ultra Triathlon Championships
at Avon Tyrrell in the New Forest was held for the first time. It
was an intimate friendly small event compared to Ironman UK. The
organisation was very good. The medal, finisher's shirt, food,
drink, energy gels and goody bag (including t/shirt, beanie and

class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The location was good with a pleasant lake
for the swim and a challenging hilly cycle course. Cattle grids,
pot-holes and New Forest horses added to the difficulty. The run
was hilly on soft ground that turned into a bog during the heavy
rain that fell throughout the final day.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>It seems that Enduroman like their events
to be a bit tough, so it was never going to be an event for PB's.
This course evidently turned out harder than anticipated as only 4
out of 20 entrants completed the deca-iron and the average
finishing time for the single-iron was 16 hours 49 mins.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>John Liebers completed the double-iron
brilliantly in 34 hours 54 mins. John achieved consistently
excellent times in all disciplines to finish 8th (despite coming
off his bike to avoid a horse in the road).</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Jim Graham did manage to register the
fastest bike lap, as if ignorant of the fact that another 19 laps
were required in addition. Jim finished 18th with a time of 37
hours 52 mins. A bit tired and wet by the end, with the last mile
taking over 30 mins of trudging through swampy conditions in the
dark. Only 25 of the 42 double-iron entrants completed the
course.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The Enduroman organisers and marshals were
fantastic. Recommended but best take the morning off work next
day.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Don't even think about doing this event
unsupported. Jim and John had a superb support team of Helen, Dave
and Ben who all deserve medals for a massive effort. Much
appreciated.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>&nbsp;2nd</strong></em><em><strong>Author: John
Liebers</strong></em></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>"30 seconds to the
start...."<span>&nbsp;</span> Steve Hayward, the race director
calls out from the jetty.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>That's close enough... I set my watch alarm
on 15min repeats then change the display back to chrono ready for
the start.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>I'd got up at 0430 that morning feeling
fairly relaxed but without any certainty about how the next couple
of days would unfold. However as I slipped off the jetty into the
water and waded out something like a big electrical relay switch
went 'CLUNK' in my head. I breathed in
deeply....<span>&nbsp;</span> "I'm here, let's get this
done".</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>"5...4...3...2...1..." the klaxon sounds
and we're off - Double Enduroman 2011; <strong>swim 4.8miles, bike
232 miles, run 52 miles</strong>.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>I find my groove and slowly count off the
swim laps. Each lap is just less than 300m round a small
picturesque woodland lake. We come through a funnel system next to
the jetty each time for the marshals to record our laps.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal">"71" I call&nbsp;out my number each time past.
"71 confirmed". And a second marshal ticks off the lap.</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The "20 laps completed" call agrees with my
own mental tally and that of my support crew... only 6 to go. I was
feeling good&nbsp;and a renewed energy anticipating the "last lap"
call as I approached the jetty 5 laps later.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>"2 laps to go..."&nbsp;&nbsp; What?...
you're bloody kidding, I thought. I'm on my last lap you
tosser.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>I politely challenge the marshal. My race
crew, who were race</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span> using a tally
counter, question the marshal as well but to no avail.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Oh well... I got to swim 5
miles.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Okay, bike leg - not 232 miles but 20 laps.
I refused to let myself think in distances... '232 miles followed
by a double marathon'. I tried to banish these measurements of
distance from my mind. Stay in the present and just count laps... 1
to 20, that's not so bad. For the same reason I'd taken my garmin
off my bike... I didn't want a constant reminder about how far I'd
gone and still had to go. Heartrate?... well I'd just try to keep
the effort steady and comfortable.<span>&nbsp;</span> Besides I
didn't want to be carrying any extra gear over that distance and
the battery wasn't designed to last long enough anyway.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Late in the day, standing out of the saddle
working my way up a short but sharp incline a car of young girls
slowed to pass me, cheering and leaning out of the window.
"Corrr... you've got a fit bum!" one of them called
out.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Well that was a better lift than any sports
gel. I had a shit-eating grin for the next couple of miles and
amused myself imagining retelling the episode to my wife..."Yeah,
they probably said you had a <em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">fat</em> bum!"</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The New Forest ponies though often standing
adjacent to and sometimes in the road seemed pretty docile and for
the most part ignored both cars and cyclists. Although initially
wary when passing them I began to get complacent as the day went
on.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Sweeping round a downhill bend I was
suddenly faced with several horses trotting along either side of
the road. I tried to scrub off some speed but not before a couple
of horses veered across in front of me. Instinctively I jammed
harder on the brakes... my back wheel skidding out beneath me.
Shit... I was going to hit that horse in front of me. I released
the pressure on my brakes to regain control of my bike and somehow
managed to miss the horse but only by riding onto the embankment at
the side of the road. As I came off my bike I thought my race was
over.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>I took the impact on my left shoulder and
upper arm but thankfully onto soft ground. I'm okay...saddle's
twisted about 70' but my bike seems okay...wheels good. Easton
wheelsets are renowned for being bloody bombproof. In my haste I
get on my bike and carry on. Thank goodness for that - I must
concentrate.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The road sweeps downwards along a fast
section of the course and I make the most of it leaning into the
bends. Johnny - you arse! You've just crashed your bike and you
haven't even checked it over properly. I slow down and pull over
and give it a proper once over. Wheels true, quick releases secure,
callipers aligned, chainset and derailleurs good, bars and headset
secure. Okay... now get back on your bike and take it
steady.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>I felt good during the night although the
temperature dropped quite a bit... down to 4'C according to the
race organisers and occasional drizzle. Stopping for the odd hot
drink or bite to eat the laps count down and soon the sun was
coming up. Ironically that was the first time I really wanted to
sleep and I was struggling to keep my eyes open. I found myself
cycling with my eyes shut...just a few moments would be
okay?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>"C'mmon<span>&nbsp;</span> Johnny!" I
shouted out loud to myself "Stay with it."</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The urge to sleep passed and soon I was
back in transition preparing for the run. My uber-efficient support
crew were like a Formula 1 pit stop team. You could almost hear the
high pitched "ZZZZiip...ZZZiip" of electrical power tools as they
undressed and re-dressed me, changed shoes, handed me food and
massaged my sore back - all at the same time. Pat on the shoulder;
thumbs up; ready to go.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The run course was a short loop on a
woodland trail passing round the lake we'd swam in yesterday. Soft
underfoot but undulating and plenty of trip
hazards.<span>&nbsp;</span> Soft underfoot eventually became ankle
deep mud in many places as the weather turned for the worse.
Relentless<span>&nbsp;</span> sheeting rain and gusting wind; a
couple of marquees and the race control tent were blown
over.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>I'd changed kit twice during the run and
had no more dry clothes left. I was running in my club bike jacket
which I can testify is definitely not waterproof.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>I'm soaked through and my core temperature
is dropping. Just stopping long enough for a hot drink I get
colder...I have to keep moving. Just over a marathon to go...
(don't think of those distances Johnny) ...but I'm shivering badly;
teeth chattering. I need to sort myself out...<span>&nbsp;</span> I
go into a toilet block adjacent to the run course to get some
temporary respite from the weather and think. I remove some wet
clothing and repeatedly use the hand driers to blow some warm air
over me... that feels good.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>As if fate Jim Graham, the other mid Sussex
tri club competitor, is in there too ...in the closed cubicle
diligently reducing his racing weight.&nbsp;I haven't seen much of
him since the bike leg but he's doing good. Jim gives me a spare
space blanket... Yea Gods! And to think I had been taking the piss
out of him on Friday for bringing so much kit! But the space
blanket alone wouldn't do the trick. Back on the course I shout out
to Ben (race crew) to bring a dustbin liner, small plastic bag and
duct tape. I was annoyed with myself for not thinking to do this
earlier. Sheltering among some trees we duct tape the space blanket
round my torso next to my skin and use the bin liner over the top
of my bike jacket. A small plastic bag taped over my head completes
the ensemble. Great - I was more waterproof and had the means to
trap some heat. After another couple of laps I was warm
again.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>The finish was sweet; not just the end of
two days racing but the culmination of eight months training. I
crossed the finish holding hands with my
children.<span>&nbsp;</span> But I will remember the race for these
other things as well:</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><em><strong>My support crew:</strong></em></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Ben my eldest son, Dave brother-in-law and
Helen, Jim Graham's wife.<span>&nbsp;</span> What a solid crew-able
to anticipate our needs and keep us going. They got little sleep
and spent the whole of Sun- cold and wet but never complained. Like
Jim said don't even think about doing a race like this with-out a
support crew. Outstanding!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Running miles 50 &amp; 51 with my
wife alongside me</span></span> <span>and <span>Friends turning up
unexpectedly</span> having driven 2hr and standing in the rain for
another 5 to help me finish.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><em><strong>The characters:</strong></em></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Both other competitors and Enduroman
organisers. Take Rev Graham - Enduroman staffer and Buddhist
priest. Gold tooth, bone earring in a stretched earlobe - kilt,
army boots and wearing his buff pirate-style. He helped keep me
running with hot beef stock drinks - it was if he was offering me
the Holy Grail full of the elixir of youth.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Craig Spring, Royal Navy, eventual winner
of Double Enduroman. Such composure; his face a study of complete
determination and focus. Walking up an incline together we reached
the point to start running again when he barked out "Right
legs...move!" and off he went already 20miles ahead of
me.<span>&nbsp;</span> Amazing.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Fabian Pwi, Singapore Army. He was wobbling
all over the road on his bike some 20hr into his race seemingly
exhausted but still completed his triple another 44hr
later.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Monique, the only female attempting the
deca (10x daily iron dist format).&nbsp;One of only 4 remaining
competitors on day9 (20 started on day1) she had to be pulled out
of the water&nbsp;due to cold injury. It seemed her race was over
but after 30min in the medical tent she was back at the jetty
getting back into her wetsuit and into the
water.<span>&nbsp;</span> "Whatta you lot staring at!" she
harangued the crowd of awestruck onlookers.... Hard as
nails!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Jim Graham for having the grit to finish
the run well into the second night in foul weather...cold,wet,muddy
and hungry...but getting the job&nbsp;done.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Everyone was hurting, but everyone still
had a ready smile and a few words of encouragement for each other.
Most didn't know the meaning of 'giving up'. I like being in the
proximity of these kind of people</span></p>

<p><span>The Dambuster adventure started the night before as our
MSTC athletes battled their way up the Motorways for a long journey
up to Leicestershire. Exhausted Rose &amp; Trev arrived at the
Travelodge at 11pm, after driving for 4 hours navigating around the
closed A1 which didn't stop Trev loading up on route for his
pre-race dinner of chips and baked beans. Trev managed 4 hours
sleep and surprisingly felt rested on the morning of the race!
While poor Rose was up at 4am for the day to begin.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Jeff had
his support team (Sue &amp; two of his daughters) with him at the
Travelodge to give home encouragement - again an early start for
them all as checkout was 5am - now that's what I call a support
team!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Nancy had
all her support team in the campervan, but next time she is very
keen to leave it at home and book a hotel (don't blame
her!).</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Poor Steve
&amp; Kay didn't arrive at the hotel</span> <span>until 00:30, so
not a good start. Kay made the wise decision that with the lack of
sleep, over worked and a bad cold that it was time to pull out and
- oh it was so tempting for sleep-deprived Steve to do the same.
Good job Steve found the strength to compete as he ended up
thoroughly enjoying the swim and achieved a fantastic
9<sup>th</sup> in his age group.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>ANT - "I
kinda went a bit off course on the swim, following a group of other
swimmers to the right on the back leg of the swim. Maybe that was
why my swim time was so slow?"</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>TREV - "I
spent half of the swim drafting Ant - I can thoroughly recommend it
as he swims in a very straight line and I would have stayed there
if some idiot hadn't rammed into me from the side. Even after I
lost him it all went very well and I loved the swim."</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Nancy - "I
was SOOO nervous beforehand but hanging out with the club members
and some spontaneous wetsuit dancing helped to calm the
nerves.&nbsp; I had a dreadful swim - kept going in the wrong
direction, more practice at Ardingly and Southwater
required!"</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>STEVE B -

"Totally loved the swim.... made the mistake of waiting at the back
to start which meant I got kicked by lots of breaststrokers :(....
but once I swam through and found clear water it was a joy..... so
came out the water with a big smile on my face.... fabulous support
from Kay... suspect I lost time telling her how much I enjoyed the
swim..... Fell over in transition think the body was still
swimming!!!!!......"<br />

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Jeff - "I
was disappointed by my swim after having done quite a bit recently,
I was a good 5mins over my normal time for 1500m, but just didn't
get into a comfortably rhythm.. Longish T1 so plenty of room for
improvement."</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Ant: "On
the bike transition I got shouted at by a&nbsp;Marshall&nbsp;for
mounting my bike before the bike start line, even though I asked
her if it was OK - she was too busy speaking to the other Marshall
and got very upset when she noticed I had got a 'leg over'.
Muttered stuff like 2 minutes time penalty, which fortunately I
didn't get.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The bike
was a bit of a nightmare for me. On the big downhill my rather
large 90cm front wheel caught some&nbsp;turbulence&nbsp;and
oscillated all the way to the bottom. How I managed to stay on is
beyond me. That kinda shook me up so all the other descents were
taken a lot slower! Traffic was also a problem in some parts as the
slower riders were holding up the cars which left no overtaking
room.</span></p>

the start of the run my quads felt completely shot, I wasn't sure
if I'd be able to manage the full 10km but after a few minutes the
pain lessened enough to establish sub 7 minute mile pace. By this
time I had spotted Macca, a quick goose on that barn door before I
pressed on, fast enough I hoped to stay in front of him (and to try
and hide how tired I felt). The run section was ace, lots of high
fives with Macc, Steve B and a quick Hi to Trev on the switchback
section. I was starting to get tired on the second loop, the run
pace was going over 7 minute mile pace now but I felt I had a big
enough lead to keep in front of Macca. I even seemed to be catching
up with Steve B, but then I hadn't realised he was running his iron
man speed in&nbsp;preparation&nbsp;for his forthcoming
event."</span></p>

"</span><span>The run I found hard but somehow did my best 10km
time for a triathlon and my 3rd best ever for a solo 10km. All this
despite my bad foot, which seems to have meant I protected it and
in the process sprained my big toe. But I never felt this to
afterwards so that was ok. I then demolished a wall at Roses and
dropped a concrete block on the same toe! Even so I still really
enjoyed it, a brilliant event. Totally recommend it."</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Nancy:
"With the run I managed to tuck in the 10k within my target of

cheer me on at the finish was great and made up for the heavy rain
showers and hail."</span></p>

Ironman)&nbsp;making sure I did not get sucked into racing other
bodies...&nbsp;It's&nbsp;harder than I thought, as my mind and body
want to race....&nbsp;Dambuster was a training race for me -
used&nbsp;it to pace out for my Ironman...Had a great race felt
very comfortable and could have&nbsp;gone round again, oh and again

"..Again all the women in the club either passed me or lapped me
but all with encouraging words.... Took time to get legs working
but a fabulous playlist from the music guys really helped.... By
the time I got to the dam it started to heavily rain then hail that
stung!!!!.... So abandoning myself to the elements I had my Kate
Bush moment along the top of the Dam!!!.... you have to laugh...
and then Julie swept past me!!!!... but I kept going aware that
Joules was just ahead of me ... but there was no catching
her!!!!!..... last bit I knew you guys would all be there and you
were.... i could have finished then... Superb moment.... I'd been
worried that the marshals would have been packing up but thankfully
they were great.... So I maintained my usual place in the last 10
in every Olympic I have done ... but this time it felt good and I
truly enjoyed it :)"</span><span><br />

"</span><span>T2 not bad and the legs took a bit of warming into
the run - suffered for the first 15 mins or so. Again, sorry Steve,
you saw me and shouted me, but I think I had my eyes closed at the
time. I caught up and overtook some of those who went passed me on
the bike, but by the end of the run I was pretty knackered. Glad to
beat the 3 hour mark, but sure I can knock 10-15mins off the total

me in the first mile as I was doing just over 8 min miles then it
was high fives all the way round, I think I could have gone faster

<p><span>No doubt you have heard of the film Nightmare On&nbsp;Elm
Street, welcome to Nightmare at Wimbleball.</span></p>

<p><br />
The day started at 06.00 with the putting on of the wet suit ready
to be walked down to the lake at 06.30. It was overcast and windy
but at least it wasn't raining, like Saturday!!! Eventually all
1600 competitors were in the very cold water having waded through
the mud!! No "God Save The Queen" this year, not that "she" will be
too worried! The gun goes off at 07.00 and we're off, not exactly
at a gallop more like a massive washing machine on fast
spin!!&nbsp;My swim was okay, got kicked a few times but isn't that
what triathlon is all about!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I exited the water on&nbsp;55 mins 17 sec&nbsp;, about 30 secs
down on last year. T1 went okay at least i didn't
get&nbsp;interviewed like last time! I was a bit unsure as what to
wear for the bike as it was still a quite cool and very windy,
anyway i opted to remain in my tri suit and put on arm warmers. The
bike course is two laps and very hilly and although it remained
cool, overcast and windy at least it didn't rain until about ten
minutes before reaching T2 but luckily it was only a short shower.
I had no problems on the bike, unlike a lot of&nbsp;others who
suffered punctures and broken chains etc. and completed the ride in
4:03:51.&nbsp;&nbsp;T2 passed without any hiccups and the sun had
come out by then, it always shines on the righteous!.</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Hope you
are covering your eyes because this is&nbsp;where the nightmare
begins,&nbsp;during the first lap i could feel the underside of my
right foot starting to niggle where i had injured it at work a week
ago! Even being passed and encouraged by John Webster [we met by
chance at the race briefing the day before] couldn't help
and&nbsp;by the end of the first lap i had been reduced to a hobble
and for a split second i thought maybe i should call it a
day!!!</span> <span>But it's an Ironman event, so&nbsp;there is NO
GAIN without PAIN!!!! How i got to the finish i don't know,&nbsp;
but i dragged myself over the line after 2hrs 42 mins
4sec.</span></p>

<p><span>My overall time&nbsp;was <strong>7hrs 53mins 15
secs,</strong> about 30 mins down on last years time. I was gutted
at the time as i had wanted to try and finish first in my age
group,</span></p>

<p><span><span>You're not going to believe this, i have just
checked the results&nbsp;&nbsp;and even with a shit performance i
came FIRST in my age group!!!! Mind you i was the only ONE !!!!
Obviously i shall be looking for the MSTC to sponsor my trip to Las
Vegas later in the year for the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS!!! Ha!
Ha!<br />

<p style="margin-top: 0cm; background: white; line-height: 12pt;">
<span>The two age group races gathered from all over Europe 1.500
to 2.000 athletes and as part of the GBR team, 3 of our own MSTC
athletes were there: <strong

<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Margaret
Hollamby</strong> and <strong
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Steve
Alden</strong>.</span></p>

<p style="background: white; line-height: 12pt;"><span>On June the
25th the sprint distance race (swim 750m, bike 20km, run 5km) took
place which included Margaret who achieved an amazing
2<sup>nd</sup> place in her age group (55-59).</span></p>

<p style="background: white; line-height: 12pt;"><span>Next day,
Rachel and Steve took part in the Standard distance race (swim
1500m, bike 40km, 10km), coming a proud 16th &amp; 11th

believe that I did the Austrian Ironman - Whoo! Hoo! Hoo! I have
spent months diligently training from the book that Tim is about to
enjoy burning and not once deceived myself that I could be as
amazingly fit and strong as you girls/guys.</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>I joined the Mid Sussex Tri Club in May
2005. I was treating Andy Heath and I am not sure if it was a
recommendation of his or if I plagued the life out of him during
the pain of having his hamstrings sorted that he mentioned he was
part of this great club. From the minute I arrived at the club I
was surrounded by lots of friendly faces and lots of encouragement.
I am so glad that all those friendly faces are still my dear
friends. For those that are new to the club beware of drinking and
or being caught in the (Steve) Alden <em>or</em> Mac magic of
entering any races..</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>So before you read this, I ask you do just
one thing for me ...I very genuinely ask that you will not judge me
and my efforts on my time. I am highly aware that those before me
on their IM quests (even double IM quests) have gone faster and
those that will follow after, will again go more speedily! So as
the first woman in the club to have ever completed an Ironman, you
might wonder why?</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>13 years ago I had a lifesaving/changing
operation and after the celebral aneurysm my life has been a
whirlwind of taking every single minute and enjoying it. I had to
learn how to talk, walk and build up from a non-existent memory in
the multiple months that followed after leaving Hurstwood Park. Tim
and I had only been married for a few months and for this I am glad
we had a great honeymoon as the shock of this operation and the
next few months and years were going to be hard.</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>My first challenge arrived when I wanted
to go back to work and was eventually allowed to go back to
something nice, enjoyable and easy. I joined a gym and loved being
the first face members saw on reception. I started getting into
fitness again and managed to get friendly with a group of women
that had just been running. Up until then I hadn't run - I wanted
in! So I starting running with them, then in Sept I entered the
London Marathon for the following year and despite huge concern
from my parents and my brothers and sisters, I ran it and finished.
That day was magnificent; my face ached for days from smiling so
much. I had at last got back a little bit of me. Illness takes away
your independence. and within the 5 hours that it took - I had this
back and a bit more confidence ..</span></p>

was start at the beginning with a big smile on my face looking out
over the lake (Rach where are you), and finish many hours later
looking utterly exhausted and smiling still (now .where did I put
that lip-gloss) knowing that I would still be loved by Tim. I truly
believe that you can do whatever you want if you work hard enough.
I only found the strength to do this IM by what I have learnt from
you all in being part of the Mid Sussex Tri Club, so Thank you. The
advice, kindness and friendship will never be forgotten.</span></p>

into Klagenfurt, there is another coach that does a bike recce. I
am worried about this. It's great that Tim can see the bike course
however I can't change what the route is going to be like and
thankfully the coach only struggles up one of the mountains. The
rest of the day goes so well with registration and racking and
before too long we are back on the coach.</span></p>

sleep, however the tiredness in my body has lost its fight to my
active mind that won't allow my body to sleep. All I keep thinking
of is did I train hard enough, I will let so many people down if
something goes wrong, I am just me, will Tim be ok. So much is
rushing through my mind.all the pleasure I have had from seeing
different parts of Sussex and Surrey on by bike, the nasty
occurrence of my restless legs that has worryingly spread to my
arms, with the endless hours of training to achieve my IM dream. My
doubts that the results of my EEG and CT scans will come back as
abnormal and that I have indeed driven my body to face some sort of
self-destruct mode. Then more doubts will my ankle behave - two
weeks ago I thought I have a stress fracture in my ankle, so a
quick visit to see Steve Bendall and lots of money later a
diagnosis of a heel spur and no running until the day (ekkk). again
I wonder whether I have misused my body and if I should be doing
this ...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work such long hours
and getting up hideously early and going to bed very late there is
no wonder I look about 90..</span></p>

for breakfast - does anyone enjoy eating at 4 am? I don't and today
even though it is the day I have trained so hard for it is
impossible to eat there are knots in my stomach and I just can't
eat. I get the 'eat' look from Tim and eat enough and wander down
with Tim to the coach. A small journey takes us in to Klagenfurt
and we follow everyone else and some newly found friends that are
also doing their first IM. The music is pumping out and we all

 class="MsoNormal"><span>We start by walking into the water and
wait for the starting clacton, I don't hear it, everyone starts
swimming, and I start swimming I still can't hear it and carry on
swimming. Its one loop into the centre of the lake and then back
through a narrow canal, which gets a bit cosy. The swim goes really
well and I love every minute of it. I get out and see that I did it
in 1:18 so not my best time and not my worst time.</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>T1 is quite a way away and the minute I am
out of the water I run along. The route is packed by so many
supporters screaming and applauding their loved ones along that I
leg it. I just have to remember that the finish line will only come
to me if I keep moving forwards...OMG at T1 you have helpers. No
other event will ever be the same! I get changed and it's a
pleasing T1 time then I am out on the bike, this course is
beautiful and an enormous part of it feeds around the lake and then
up into the mountains and then back around again. I am so pleased
that I did 7 lots of 100 miles pre this race as it means apart from
any failing mechanics I can just focus on pedalling around and
taking in the view.</span></p>

through the hanging bags - doh! So I am grateful to the helpers
inside the tent that I decide not to waste time and getting changed
and before I know it I start the run. I have seen Tim quite a few
times now and I feel good. My smile is still in place and a huge
amount of relief that the next part is down to the strength and
determination to finish.</span></p>

through my head, stop at every feed station and let the crowd spur
you on, keep positive and Tim has some pictures that are of some
very special people in my life. I have had so much water and the
right amount of gels that it's wonderful to find some yummy
watermelon on the course and as the weather has been kind so I
don't hang on to the sponges for long. I run for the first 6 miles
and then my ankle feels very sore. This isn't good. I keep running
and think about the time left. I have 5 hours to do this
in.</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>I start walking and I mean power walking,
my walk is fast and I can see Tim. His support has been unreal. I
continue to walk and it's a now a race against time. I am not going
to ruin my ankle and run, this walk is faster than my Ironman
shuffle and every so often I can hear the tannoy announcing that
someone else is an IRONMAN. I keep going, everyone is showing the
signs of determination and I think of you all, my family and Tim
and start running again. This isn't for long - my ankle is very
tender and swollen now, and it is the final lap of 13 miles. I am
willed on by everyone and there is a strong connection between
everyone racing that we are all Ironmen all that is to be decided
is our times. I keep going and I can hear music. The carpet leads
the competitors along to the finishers stadium and the IM podium is
600m away.</span></p>

is lining the route, all you can hear is the smacking of the bang
bangs, everyone singing and dancing to the music, screaming your
name and I run ..like I have never run before and then I hear the
most magical voice... Claire from Great Britain you are an
...IRONMAN.</span></p>

along with Kate's amazing efforts at Switzerland and Jade at Outlaw
(wishing you both the very best of luck) Perhaps some more women
will follow in my footsteps...so for this reason only Tim..perhaps
don't burn that book yet.. I think that I have at last found at
last my distance</span></p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span></span> <span><span>On Saturday, the 2<sup>nd</sup> July,
there were many different ladies only races going on at Dorney
Lake, with Clare, Jean &amp; Sharon in the Challenge triathlon and
Fiona in the Sprint. So here are two race reports for
you:</span></span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Author: Sharon</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Left the house at 7.30am which is not too
early; apart from my teenage kids thinking that they have been
woken up in the middle of the night. My crew in the car were:
Gordon (hubby), Sean &amp; Alina - the kids. We were hoping to
catch up with the other car - Clare, Jean &amp; Rob (Jean's hubby).
Unfortunately 15mins up the road and we are straight back to the
house for the forgotten camera.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>No sign of Jean's car but the M25 was
blissfully quiet and drama-free so we made great time to Dorney
Lake.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>There were loads of parking and a bit of
walk to the boathouse so support crew were handed equipment to
carry &amp; off we went. The walk helped to settle the nerves a bit
- worrying about all the unknowns for my first open water
triathlon; the mass swim start, spotting &amp; getting out of the
spray-on wetsuit.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Saw three lovely smiling faces waiting for
us outside the registration tent - Rob was trying to stay cheerful
as when he had first spotted the large registration tent, he
thought it was full of beer.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>After collecting my number, we headed for
the posh boathouse and upstairs to the balcony &amp; café, which
gives great views of the Lake and an excellent place to settle all
the support crew who immediately organised themselves bacon
sandwiches - oh crikey I'm going to hurl, there goes the nerves
again.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>As Clare, Jean &amp; I racked our bikes,
we were able to watch the first Wave enter the water. <span></span>
The first group were the Relay team and there didn't seem to be
many of them so gave us all the wrong impression that the groups
were going to be small. Not long before it's our time to wander
down to the start position &amp; there were LOADS of us (our wave -
under 30s &amp; over 40s). Clare was the bravest - going in without
the wetsuit - whereas Jean &amp; I just went "NO WAY - gives us the
rubber".</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>All in the water, treading and trying to
find our space while listening to the race briefing - excellent
place to tell you the race details - knowing full well that you
couldn't escape at this point. Then went the Starting Gun &amp;
wow! Arms, legs everywhere, all trying to head for the
1<sup>st</sup> buoy. Had to stop as goggles were knocked off and
then tried to avoid the kicking breast stroker. Going round the
first buoy, someone actually grabbed my ankle. First time ever I
was actually kicking!</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Swim was 2 laps - bizarrely 800m in open
water doesn't seem so long or so hard compared to a pool
environment. After the race I discovered from the support team that
the girl who was leading mistakenly starting heading back to the
first buoy instead of the finish ramp &amp; had to be chased by the
speed boat to correct her. Even with her extra 200m-ish, she still
managed to beat the rest of us.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Hit the finish ramp with my hands,
straight up and running (first fear dealt with as I thought my legs
were going to be too wobbly). The wetsuit came off so smoothly -
shock - (2<sup>nd</sup> fear dealt with) but then I had to sit on
the floor to put shoes on as felt a bit dizzy. Out of T1, next came
Jean - who absolutely loved her first experience of open water
racing and then Clare.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>I loved the cycle ride as it is SO flat,
no cars and the surface is lovely &amp; smooth. Its 6 laps around
the lake and some excellent corners to take. Only time in each lap
you had to slow down was when you return to the boathouse as
caution was required from cyclist coming from the T1 slip way and
supporters crossing the path. All our support crew were giving us
great encouragement as we went past them on each lap - is that
bloody ice-creams in their hands?????</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>T2 was okay, and then onto the run. A bit
of a boring route as up &amp; down the same path for 3 laps.
Excellent option to check that everyone is okay. Saw Clare (looking
strong and happy) while on my 1<sup>st</sup> lap but where is Jean?
- getting worried now! The positive aspect of the run is that it is
as flat as a pancake, so my currently sore knees weren't suffering
too much (last fear sorted).</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Finally last lap &amp; it is so hot, just
kept looking straight ahead, counting to 100 and not worrying what
other ladies were doing &amp; then finally, I would love to say a
sprint but more like a crawl to the finish line. Here I was met by
a group of sweet cheering marshals, our screaming support crew and
a dodgy looking man with a garden hose splashing everyone with cold
water. In other circumstances he probably would have got a slap but
this time I was truly grateful. Not long after a beaming Clare
&amp; then a smiling Jean crossed the finish line.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Now to hear "what had happened to poor
Jean" - to be honest we are not really sure as number of laps are
not officially counted, but we think that most probably Jean did an
extra bike lap - I told you the bike route was so good - you just
want to do more!</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>After we packed up and were ready to go
home we were lucky to have a chance to cheer Fiona as she headed to
the finish line - my god that girl can run.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>To summarise I think I can happily say
from all 4 of us that Dorney Lake is an excellent venue for
competing and for your spectators. All the races were very well
organised and had a great buzzing atmosphere - but no beer tent -
sorry Rob.</span></p>

boathouse and race registration. &nbsp;After collecting my numbers
and timing chip there were lots of green hats in the water.

challenge event. &nbsp;The hooter went and there was flying arms

 class="MsoNormal"><span>Racked the bike trying to remember the
tips Steve B gave me at East Grinstead and then it was just a case
of waiting. &nbsp;This was probably the worst part of the day as
thoughts of getting stuck in my wetsuit or further bike
malfunctions did nothing to calm my nerves! &nbsp;Standing on the
balcony at the boathouse looking down on transition I was trying to
spot the others but sadly didn't see them before the start of my
wave.</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>I was glad that I had a couple of Ardingly
swim sessions under my belt as I made my way to the water and
chatting to some of the other competitors who were first timers I
started to enjoy the moment! &nbsp;The marshals friendly banter
certainly helped and by the time I'd swam round the second buoy I
was really enjoying the swim. &nbsp;Was surprised to get a mouthful
of weeds and realised that I'd veered off to the left on the final
approach to the pontoon - idiot! I didn't struggle with the wetsuit
as I'd thought but my 2:51 T1 will need some work! &nbsp;The bike
course was great fun and cycling with two fully inflated tyres
makes it all the more easier. &nbsp;I knew I would have been slower
on the swim but wasn't sure how many people were in front of me on
the bike. &nbsp;It was also difficult to work out who was who as
they were different waves out on the course so I just kept
pedalling and praying for incident free cycling. &nbsp;At the end
of my final lap I was expecting a marshal to point me in the
direction of transition but nothing so I was glad that I'd kept
count myself.....it was 4 laps, wasn't it? &nbsp;Now for the real
test, running off the bike. &nbsp;Dodged past some milling
competitors in transition and made my way out onto the run course.
&nbsp;Getting off the bike I realised just how warm it was out
there and hoped that my legs wouldn't cramp up. &nbsp;I heard some
shouts of encouragement, which was a real boost. &nbsp;I certainly
found it harder to run a 5k after the swim and the bike, and kept
thinking to myself that I really should have practised some more
brick sessions. &nbsp;The sight of the finish arch after my second
lap was a welcome sight and crossing the line I was very surprised
and pleased to be given 2nd place in my wave. &nbsp;I'd completed
my first tri and it was worth the wait!</span></p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>The Olympic distance race will be held on Sunday 24th July at
Ardingly Reservoir.</p>

<p>This race&nbsp;is open to all members.&nbsp; We want to
encourage everybody to have a go at the event given that the
emphasis for most is on having the opportunity to do an Olympic
distance event in a familiar and supportive&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;
It is also cheap and involves little traveling or additional
costs.&nbsp;We don't have marshals around the course although the
bike and run routes are well signed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1500 swim will be a 2 lap course in the reservoir.&nbsp; For
those who are a little worried about the swim distance, rest
assured that the route is along the normal swim lanes for Saturday
morning swimming and there will be a safety boat and a canoeist in
the water&nbsp; at all times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transition area is set up on the grass adjacent to the car
park.</p>

<p>The 40 km bike course is essentially a slightly shortened route
of the course used for the middle distance event last year.&nbsp;
It is a bit lumpy but not that bad and quite enjoyable - especially
on the down hill parts on the return section.</p>

<p>The 10km run is on the paths around the reservoir.&nbsp; It is
wholly off road and, while there is likely to be some pedestrian
traffic, it is safe and flat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The briefing is at 0645.&nbsp; The swim starts in one wave at
0700.</p>

<p>We really want people to have a go at this -irrespective of
ability or speed or any thing else.&nbsp; The main point is having
a go at this distance and seeing what happens.&nbsp; Mark Jordan
and Steve Alden are more than happy to speak to any body who wants
to ask any questions that are not covered in the information sheets
and entry forms.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Middle distance</strong><br />
The middle distance event will be held at the same venue on Sunday
29th August.&nbsp; Again we want people to have a go at the
distance, even if it is as part of a relay team or to do one or two
of the elements.&nbsp; The course is exactly the same as that for
last year and, as such, an extended route from that of the Olympic
distance.</p>

<p>The middle course has been set as:<br />
1.&nbsp;an open water swim over a 1.9 Km course in the Ardingly
Reservoir.&nbsp; The course is 3 laps of an out and back route of
600 metres per lap (300 metres out - 300 metres back) with an
additional 100 metre swim to the finish at the
slipway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;a cycle route of 79.25 Kms that will be held entirely on
open public roads, where there will be unrestricted vehicular,
pedestrian and other traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a relatively
hilly, testing and technical course.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;a 20-ish Km run over a course that is mainly on
off-road, public footpaths and bridleways adjacent to the Ardingly
Reservoir.</p>

<p>The start will be at 0700, just after a briefing.&nbsp;
Arrangements will be similar to those for the Olympic distance but
with a water station for the second lap of the bike course and a
water station at the run turn round point.&nbsp;</p>

]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;<span>I know it's very long. Wrote this at the
airport.</span></p>

<p><span>There's also a really short 'My Journey' in the
end.</span></p>

<p><span>It was no small task just to get there and back on my
own.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Found it
difficult to unbox bike, get all my stuff to transition and back to
hotel,</span> <span>box bike afterwards to leave hotel room by
10am.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I refused
to use the overpriced taxis and transfers and juggled both
cardboard bike box and suitcase which proved to be harder than
expected because the swiss seem to love steps and dislike
lifts.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There were
steps up to the train station both direction, up to the train
itself, then inside the train. Airport is full of steps and the
small hotel didn't have a lift, either.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Zurich is
charming btw, beautiful location as well.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I've run
into two problems straight.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The fire
alarm was beeping constantly in my room in need of new
batteries</span> <span>and my tooth crown have fallen out. Glued it
back with superglue.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I've found
locals much more helpful when speaking german.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Not a nice
start but at least got exhausted from it and slept really very
well.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>(Despite
the tram station just under the window and the church bell over the
road</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>signing
every quarter of an hour once and every hour - that means 12 at
midnight).</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Slept well
again and was full of energy in the morning. Loved the buzz</span>
<span class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>in
transition</strong></span></span><span>.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Admired the
pros - Ronnie Shildknecht seemed very relaxed -</span> <span>and
admired their bikes. They are very small frames btw, the first two
women's bike (K.Thurig, E.Csomor) had even smaller than regular
wheels.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span
class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>The swim</strong></span></span>
<span>was very crowded from start to finish.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was a
run into water start which I've never done before.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There has
been a women only start which I used but soon we all got mixed
up.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was the
most aggressive swim I've done and it never settled
down.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Sometimes I
had to fight just to stay on surface although I swum very
wide.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Maybe I
just had been at an unfortunate crowded place I couldn't get out
off.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There was a
small island to run through and there was a queue in front of the
ramp</span> <span>with extra punching.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>A huge huge
ship also came very close in the second lap causing big
waves.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I even got
seasick from floating that much up and down but it went away
soon.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>All in all
slowest swim ever for me by far.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There has
been no race clock at all except at the finish line</span>
<span>(which you saw every lap on the run) so luckily I didn't know
my time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Took time
to calm down in</span> <span
class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>T1</strong></span></span>
<span>after the stressful swim and started the bike feeling
fresh.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Btw the
bikes were racked very tight. From 'head to toe' so the back wheels
really didn't count but the drops were tangled with both
neighbouring bikes' drops.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There was
so little space the bikes maybe wouldn't have fitted in in their
boxes.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Feared the
bike course a lot. Mapmyride and ridewithgps showed me huge hills
with steep, technical descents. I was told it was not so bad and I
would make it but I didn't believe in it.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Just bought
the bike last August, had to learn all those technical bits
(clipless, tri bar, tyres and tubes, gears, tools, co2 cartridges)
that come natural to cyclists but I had no cue.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I'd like to
thank you for all the good advice.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Had cadence
related knee problems till April. I've sorted it out at last,
probably a bit too late.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I couldn't
release my grip on the go so had to stop just to drink in the
beginning.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Using tri
bars or cornering was unrealistic at least.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>My bike
handling did get slightly better still I felt I wasn't
ready.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I
loved</span> <span class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>the
bike</strong></span></span> <span>course. A bit hilly, yes, but not
too bad</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In fact
I've done a lot hillier in training.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>After the
Beast I knew I'd make it if I got no technical problems with the
bike.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I hadn't,
although I was worried about a disturbing noise in the smaller
gears.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There has
been a huge thunderstorm lasting about 90 min with deafening
lightnings and very strong headwind just as I'd been on a long
exposed drag called Beauty on the second lap.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>(My two
longest training rides proved to be very helpful after
all.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The first
bit of SRS Eastbourne was very windy - bike stopped on a downhill
at Beachy Head</span> <span>and it has been raining for 6 hours
straight during Tour the Weald.)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Could
hardly see the road from the heavy rain so had to be careful, there
has been branches and puddles on road. Couldn't use the tri bars
afterwards but it has been useful till then.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>At my speed
it's not that more aero but I felt the difference in the
wind</span> <span>and it provided me with another comfortable hand
position.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It also
held my third drink bottle as I thought I'd have to stop for
getting the bottles at feed stations and the less I needed to stop
the better.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I was
surprised how easy it was getting a bottle from a
helper,</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>although I
got soon sick from PBdrinks and sticked to water from then
on.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Had a bento
box for the bars and a gel bottle, too. Precious advice it was,
thanks.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Nutrition
on the bike is crucial for a strong finish. You must literally
stuff yourself.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I actually
counted the calories and carbs for my HIM and sticked to that
amount per hour later in training. Unfortunately couldn't eat even
close to plan during IM. I'm sure I'd have got into serious
difficulties late in the marathon if I'd sticked to my usual
pace.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It's held
on open roads but it was very low traffic and marshalls stopped
cars at junctions and roundabouts.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There were
no signs at all (except no aero bar descent signs) but marshalling
on the bike route was very good by the time I got there -
<span>&nbsp;</span> but two pros got lost. How could that
happen?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Also at
around 40k there has been a curb on course. It was on a descend,
second part of a corner. I'm not sure if I'd have seen it without
slowing down because of the ambulance. Poor chap didn't look good
at all. There has been two more curbs to negotiate but not in
corners.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Heartbreak
Hill is steepish but quite short. Well, second time it seemed
steep.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>First lap
was amazing but scary here. A'la Tour de France the crowds are
crazy leaving just a small gap to get through. My adrenaline level
shot high as it was way too close for my liking.</span></p>

the pros and the top age groupers. I loved it.</span></p>

hot again soon. Late in the run oranges, pretzels and soup were
welcome.</span></p>

qualifiers wouldn't get their slots if they wouldn't be there at
the very moment he announced their name at the award ceremony.

get the slot.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>He told us
there has been huge debates over this in the past but as long as he
was race director it'd get allocated this way. His approach simply

<h3><span>The journey</span></h3>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>No one
could have foreseen this 2 years ago.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In</span>
<span class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>July
2009</strong></span></span> <span>I was 223lbs /over 100 kg with
four young kids feeling very miserable.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I wanted to
do sg with my looks. I saw all the runners in town and decided to
give it a go.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I've never
done any sports before and realized I couldn't run with that weight
on.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I started
swimming. Could do sg similar to breaststroke but couldn't do the
front crawl.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I learned
it from the web (goswim, swimsmooth) then joined the</span> <span
class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>Marlins</strong></span></span>
<span>in</span> <strong><span class="Heading3Char"><span>Sept
2009</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>still not
able to do one length. Jon didn't want to have me but I'd been
desperate by then.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In</span>
<span class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>Nov
2009</strong></span></span> <span>I started jogging. Taking up
running for the first time in life is very rewarding.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I'll always
remember</span> <span class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>my first
jog ever</strong></span></span><span>. It didn't last a minute.
Improved every week.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In</span>
<span class="Heading3Char"><span><strong>Jan
2010</strong></span></span> <span>I went down for a swim on a

do it helps a lot, too.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I did have
an awful lot of smaller problems with cycling all
season.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Mostly knee
ligament issues but I also went down on ice in January hurting my
shoulder</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>and got
stung by a wasp on the eyelid on my very last ride before IM. My
eyelids got swollen,</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I had
trouble just to get home and half my face was painful for
days.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>These
difficulties can be overcome, they probably made me even more
determined.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It might
not be for everyone, though. It's either slooow or very
tough.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I do enjoy
being slow on my own and relaxing.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Also I
think I couldn't get much faster. I tried but don't enjoy intervals
at all.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I must be a
longer distance type because I start to feel really good only after
about an hour.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It doesn't
take that much time if you use your time wisely.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Indoor
trainer is unfortunately a must for time saving.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Less than
an hour on it makes me tired every time. If I'm really pushing it
20 min does it.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>You don't
have to run a lot for an IM marathon finish. 3 shorter runs a week
is enough.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>(Less than
4-4.30 must be different.)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I've
averaged only one run a week plus a 15min brick run every other
week this year. Sad.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Last year
I've been running a lot. But you've got only so many hours a
week.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I love
swimming and prioritized cycling because I wasn't able to hold the
needed speed for even half (or quarter of) an hour in the
beginning. So running became last and got dropped week after
week.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I did 2
marathons and several HMs before so I knew I would manage it
somehow.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>During the
run I couldn't know how much more energy I'd got or whether my
digestion would last and I wanted a sure finish.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In March
during a longer brick session I collapsed. A complete stranger
called my hubby.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I even had
gastrointestinal bleeding. Most scary.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>My hubby
got home unexpectedly early. I've just eaten my curry but forgot
about it and decided to use the extra time for training. Felt good.
Pushed it.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It happened
in seconds. Didn't really have time to react. I felt falling down
and blacked out.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I guess I'd
pushed through severe hypoglycaemia because I couldn't digest the
curry on the bike and wasn't eating either as I've just
eaten.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Didn't dare
to run for quite a while after this.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>After
seeing so many people sick on the first lap (light coloured shorts
in an IM marathon look really disgusting with brownish filling) I
decided to go deliberately slower.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>My Garmin
was most helpful with pacing. Finishing time really didn't
matter.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Most
probably I couldn't have been much faster anyway.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was like
a good party, enjoyed every minute of it.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I was

no muscle or other pain at all.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Next
time</span>&nbsp;<span>I might push it having a time goal in mind
but I didn't want to risk</span> <span>my first IM finish. I did
sprint the last km.</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[I never thought that we could get 29 people to start an Olympic distance event. It is a huge achievement that this has happened, especially at such a great venue. About a dozen had never attempted the distance before.
]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>It was also perfect weather which was great after such a damp
week. It was a bit of a rush getting transition sorted out, but we
were away by 7.30.</p>

<p>The water was about as perfect as lake swimming gets, with the
temperature spot on and totally clean. Steve Mac got out first in
25m45s with Phil Couch just 15 seconds down, and Robin a further
minute down, after that everyone came in small groups until the
last one Callum who still swam a creditable 42m27s. He has a
different view of his swim and what happened next and his superb
report is at the end of the sheet.&nbsp; Martin managed to breast
stroke powerfully most of the way round, and is now gaining more
confidence in the swim.</p>

<p>Then everyone was through T1 and onto the challenging bike
course.&nbsp; I certainly did not make it easy by having an
unfixable problem with my rear tyre which caused the feeling of the
brakes being on whenever I went uphill. Luckily it was a flat
course so there was no real problem. Although, as everyone found -
it really is relentless hills especially when you are trying as
hard as you can. When I checked the bike afterwards it was clear I
was lucky not to have exploded the tyre as it had worn away so
much.</p>

<p>Naturally James Dear was the king of the bike with a seriously
impressive ride. He started 5m50s behind Phil and started the run
4m25s ahead - an incredible 10m15s gain! And Phil had the 6th
fastest bike split even though he found it tough. James did 69m41s
including both transitions, and only 6 people broke 80mins. There
were plenty of races within the race on the bike. Colin actually
tried to keep up with James (downhill!) and even overtook him, but
the effort caught up with him later.</p>

<p>The women's race was interesting with Fiona having to start her
chase down of the others from way behind after the swim (in 8th
place ) to start the run in 2nd place behind Hazel who was out of
the water first, and then had the second fastest bike split after
Fiona. Sharon started the run third after quite a battle with
Fiona. Lucy was about 3 minutes further back.</p>

<p>On this sort of course the run becomes quite difficult after the
demands of the bike lap. The fact that the fastest run was 42m45s
(Phil and Bob) on an accurately measured 10k shows just how much
had been taken out of even the fast boys. Only 5 people even broke
45 minutes. Phil Couch recovered from his bike leg to regain 2nd
spot from Rob, but even though he gained a minute on James it was
not enough to catch him, so James took the victory with 3 minutes
to spare. Rob remained very comfortable in 3rd place with a 6
minute cushion over Colin. At this point there was a lot of
competition with 8 places being separated by a mere 4 minutes.</p>

<p>In the women's race Hazel started the run with more than 6
minutes in hand but Fiona gave it all she had to finish the day
with fastest bike and run splits (her run was an impressive 46m43s)
and was barely 3 minutes behind at the end. Lucy also charged
through the field, having come out of the swim in her customary
position as last lady. She finished the bike in 4th spot and then
reeled in Sharon on the run after starting some 3 minutes behind.
Sharon was suffering however, and felt she had run her slowest ever
10K. Lucy meanwhile took advantage of Callum feeling dreadful to
also sneak past him, which she was secretly quite pleased
about.&nbsp; Actually she wasn't that secret about it. She was
delighted!</p>

<p>I have to mention some of those who were doing this distance for
the first time. Robin shows huge potential. He had a super quick
swim, a comfortable bike and enough of a race spirit to push
himself harder when he knew I was breathing down his neck towards
the end. Pete Harris was a picture of pain on the run but I have a
feeling he will learn a huge amount from this race and then become
a very strong triathlete. Carl faded on the run after a storming
bike leg, but clearly has a lot of talent.</p>

<p>Of the other athletes it was amazing seeing Tim finish his first
Olympic. This was a man who never thought he would do any
triathlons, and I am sure I heard him say afterwards that it was
easier than sprint distance. I look forward to seeing Tim at the
middle distance race in 5 weeks, as that should be even easier!
Nikki and Jean also did incredibly well. Nikki had her baby just
over 6 months ago. Nice to see Dave doing the baby care. Jean just
seemed to be enjoying every minute.</p>

<p>Dave Lashbrook deserves a special mention. He is just coming
back from injury and was clearly way off his normal form.
Nevertheless he turned up and pushed himself as hard as he could in
the circumstances and still finished 10th. Hopefully he will be
fully fit for the middle distance soon.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Callum's view from the rear</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
My first Olympic-distance race and my first competitive open water
swim.&nbsp; Gulp.&nbsp; After about 100 metres of the swim I start
to panic and have to consciously try to calm myself down, despite
all the open water practice this year.&nbsp; That's the first time
I think seriously of abandoning.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By now, there are already three of us adrift at the back and,
amazingly, I make it to the turn buoy first of the three, but only
because the other two- Jean and someone in a silver cap - head too
far off to the left and, while they're re-orientating themselves I
slip in first.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the way back to the pontoon I just about stay in touch, but by
the time we reach the turn buoy again, and after a brief
inadvertent tussle with the swimmer in the silver cap, I am
undeniably in last position and beginning to struggle.&nbsp; I am
very, very thankful to the two canoeists - Mat and Paul - for
escorting me on the final, interminable section towards the slipway
as I begin to feel, frankly, a bit weird.&nbsp; As we approach the
pontoon, I again think of abandoning, but decide I'll struggle on
to the slipway and then pack it in.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Guided to the slipway by the fluorescent jackets of the marshals, I
find to my surprise that I can stand up, but announce that I'm
abandoning, so just go on standing there for a bit, still feeling
weird.&nbsp; Then I think I might as well head for transition,
pulling down the top half of my wetsuit as I do so.&nbsp; I try a
tentative jog down the grass and find, again to my surprise, that I
can manage a kind of run-hobble type of action.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In transition, there's obviously only one bike left, and Steve
Birchall has unhooked it for me and is urging me to get on
it.&nbsp; So, unwilling to disappoint him, I do and I'm off on the
bike leg.&nbsp; How has that happened?&nbsp; Didn't I
abandon?&nbsp; Oh well, I think, at least I can just turn left when
I get to Ardingly and freewheel back to the reservoir.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But on the way to Ardingly I overtake one or two others and begin
to think maybe I'll at least finish the bike leg.&nbsp; Then, past
Ardingly, I overtake one or two more and am beginning to feel a bit
more normal.&nbsp; At the roadworks I see someone who has been held
up by the lights and catch up with them about the Duke's Head
roundabout.&nbsp; It's Lucy.&nbsp; I overtake her going strongly
along the bypass past Copthorne, but as I head off up the road over
the M23 she's right behind me and overtakes me as the road gets
steeper.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then it's nip and tuck, cat and mouse for the next mile or so, with
me in front on the flat bits and her in front on the hills until
she finally shakes me off on the long slog up towards the Cowdray
Arms from the crossing back over the M23.&nbsp; Strong riding,
Lucy!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Still, I'm going quite well now and allow myself to think for the
first time that I could actually finish this bloody race.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Back in transition, running shoes on and I'm off on the run,
turning down the offer of a water bottle as I go through the
kissing gate.&nbsp; Bad move, but I've had a stitch throughout the
race and only managed to get through about half of the energy drink
in my bottle on the bike, and don't want to make it worse on the
run.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Going over the causeway for the first time I'm beginning to run
quite well and catch up with Lucy, who has the time and breath to
discuss the incentive to keep going offered by the rear view of the
runner in front (a male club member who will remain
nameless).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Enough of this levity, and I eventually manage to overtake Lucy and
reach the turn point going well - well enough that I even catch up
with Dave Lashbrook heading back towards the kissing gate (except
he's on his second time around and I'm only on my first).&nbsp; At
some point I also overtake Sharon.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then just ahead of the kissing gate, a great wave of nausea and
faintness overtakes me and I think (yet again) that I'll have to
abandon, but I reach the gate, take a drink of water and feel
slightly better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So I head off back up the track and reach the turn point without
further incident, spurred by shouts of encouragement from Clare
Parkinson. But on the way back again, the waves of nausea come more
and more frequently and I have to slow down and, guess what, Lucy
overtakes me again, shouting to Claire Cresswell, who's coming the
other way: "I'm ahead of Callum, I'm beating Callum!"<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And she does, with a tremendous finishing sprint down the grass
which I can't even think of matching.&nbsp; It's all I can do to
stagger over the line, fall over and get cramp so badly in one of
my legs I have to ask someone to stretch it for me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Oh well.&nbsp; It's not glorious.&nbsp; It's not fast.&nbsp; I took
on a woman and lost.&nbsp; But I finished, and that in itself is a
minor miracle.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the swimmer in the silver cap?&nbsp; Turns out that was Lucy as
well.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span>Having lived in Milton Keynes for a fair old time,
participating in the Big Cow Milton Keynes triathlon (also the
standard distance age group championships) is a good excuse to go
back up and meet up with some old friends. (I decided to register
on the Saturday, thinking I'd have a bit of a lie in on the Sunday
(race day). Unfortunately I cut things a bit fine and only managed
to get to transition with 5 minutes to spare. Having been kicked
out of transition I then realised that I didn't have my race chip;
it was back in the car. Queue a frantic barefoot rush back to the
car to get it, and then a mad dash back to the swim start with
about 5 minutes to go before my wave started.</span></p>

<p><span>Now, as everyone at MSTC knows, the swim is definitely my
Achilles heel and today was no different. I got a fair bit bashed
about in the swim which had a technical 'W' route which made
sighting quite critical. The back straight was directly into the
sun which made sighting of the last buoy almost impossible until it
was about 20 yards away.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoPlainText"><span>A
pedestrian T1 and off on the bike section. It was at this point
that I had realised that I had cocked up my Garmin 310XT multisport
mode - having forgotten to include transitions it thought I was now
on the run rather than on the bike leg. The cycle was s short 39Km,
although the course was quite undulating.<span>&nbsp;</span> This
year the course was a single large loop, so only one trip up
'heartbreak hill' where it joins the A509 main road before looping
back to Emberton. Entry back into T2 was interesting as I overshot
the entrance slightly, turning back I got a tri bar up my bottom
from the competitor behind me, I'm sure not quite the wind tunnel
effect he was envisaging when he fitted them.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoPlainText">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoPlainText"><span>The run
leg was the standard 3 lap loop of the lake with a drinks station
at the start of each lap. Water or High 5 could be obtained,
although when the kids that were helping were offering High 5's I
had though they meant high 5 slaps rather than energy drinks.
Doh!</span></p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span><span>The
Journey</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Why I
decided to do an Ironman?<span>&nbsp;</span> Many many people asked
me this question, but the best answer I can find is, 'Why
not?'<span>&nbsp;</span> After reading a few books about
inspirational people (Rosie Swale Pope to name one) and how far you
can push your body, mind over matter etc I wanted to put this to
the test.<span>&nbsp;</span> I'm from a running (I use the word
'running' loosely) background, starting running in 2008 I did the
Great South Run, then progressing in 2009 to a few half marathons,
and Tough Guy, onto 2010 and some Marathons, Tough Guy and a couple
of Olympic Tris.<span>&nbsp;</span> I think you can see a pattern
emerging here, I enjoy challenging myself and pushing myself to new
and ultimately longer distances.<span>&nbsp;</span> After going on
Runners World and speaking to the pirates (a group of lovely
likeminded people on the forum who love triathlon, and helping
others on their journey) I fell in love with their crazy ways, and
their fantastic attitude to Ironman.<span>&nbsp;</span> Not only
that, but to have friends along the way and out on a course which
ultimately is a lonely sport, gave me the push to sign up for the
Outlaw...why not eh?<span>&nbsp;</span> I told my Mum and Dad, they
thought I was mad, supporting me all the way but I could see they
thought I had gone bonkers and was potentially going to kill
myself!<span>&nbsp;</span> I told my ex, and many friends, who also
thought I was insane, but know me well enough to know what I'm
like, and that I would do this regardless.<span>&nbsp;</span> So in
January my training started in earnest.<span>&nbsp;</span> Apart
from my 25 mile rides for the Oly distances, I was rubbish on a
bike, so I decided to sacrifice most of my run training to get out
on the bike as much as possible... this turned out to be exactly
the right thing to do.<span>&nbsp;</span> Plus with 5 marathons
under my belt by April this year, I knew I had it in my legs to do
one (or at least I was mentally prepared for what I would face on
the run).<span>&nbsp;</span> Swimming I was slow but comfortable
with, but I knew I needed help so I joined Mid Sussex Tri Club, who
have been amazing.<span>&nbsp;</span> Supportive and helpful, but
also and maybe most importantly just as crazy as
me.<span>&nbsp;</span> When I told them I was doing an Ironman,
they didn't have that 'your crazy' look in their eyes that everyone
else did, instead they gave me valuable help and advice (Steve Mac
and Phil Knock to name just a couple who gave me so much invaluable
information)<span>&nbsp;</span> So with a not too structured
training plan (and nutritional plan of pot noodles and bananas) I
was good to go.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span><span>The Build
Up</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The week
leading up to the race I was really excited, but when I got to HPP
on Friday and registered, I started to become
terrified.<span>&nbsp;</span> I just couldn't bring myself to even
think about it, as I thought I might
hyperventilate.<span>&nbsp;</span> On Saturday I racked my bike,
put my bags into transition (after checking them several million
times) and went back to the campsite.<span>&nbsp;</span> Later on
Mum, Jess the piratedog and myself went to track down some
pirates.<span>&nbsp;</span> We came across a lovely circle of
pirate folk , and chatting to them really calmed my
nerves.<span>&nbsp;</span> When I got back to the tent I read a
couple of race reports, but it was a verse taken from a book at the
end of Steve Macs race report from Switzerland that completely
calmed me down and made me think 'Just enjoy it what will be, will
be'.<span>&nbsp;</span> So I slept solidly from about 11 to 3.30,
result!<span>&nbsp;</span> I even snoozed the alarm a couple of
times.<span>&nbsp;</span> Lots of porridge and a banana and I was
all set.<span>&nbsp;</span> Calm on the outside, complete bits on
the inside.<span>&nbsp;</span> I took my mp3 player down to the
lake and amongst the chaos I put my earphones in, shut away the
world for 7 minutes 19 seconds, closed my eyes and listened to Muse
'Citizens Erased'.... I was ready to race.<span>&nbsp;</span> Hug
to Mum, and as I'm about to go through to the starting bays my Dad
arrives and gives me a big hug too!<span>&nbsp;</span> Its great to
know they are both there to watch.</span></p>

1.32.40</span></strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I stay at
the back of Bay 2, which turned out to be a great idea, as everyone
swam off ahead I had no kicks or punches.<span>&nbsp;</span> As
everyone met before the first buoy it became a little more crowded
but again no problems, and even a few feet to
follow.<span>&nbsp;</span> My aim was just to relax, enjoy it, and
use it as a warm up...expected time 1.30-1.40.<span>&nbsp;</span>
It took me until about 1000 mtrs to settle down (there are signs
with the distance all along the lake) and the cramp in my right
calf was actually a blessing, as I then stopped using my legs
completely, stretched out my stroke and really relaxed, the turn
around point came quickly, and with it I even overtook a few
people!<span>&nbsp;</span> On the leg back my mum, dad &amp; Jess
were following<span>&nbsp;</span> me along the bank (Jess even
jumped in the lake at one point!), It was great to see them every
6<sup>th</sup> stroke, and when I had to clear my goggles I would
give them a little wave, and get shouts of encouragement
back.<span>&nbsp;</span> Out of the water in 1.32.40 and chuffed to
bits.</span></p>

7.09.28</span></strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Loved the
bike!!<span>&nbsp;</span> This was the part I was most worried
about, as I felt least experienced, and so much could potentially
go wrong.<span>&nbsp;</span> But for some reason, whether it was
all the training, I was just having a 'good day' or the reason I
most like to think...that my granddad was giving me a big push from
up above, whatever it was it worked!<span>&nbsp;</span> I had done
two laps in training and found Oxton bank a bit painful the second
time round, but on the day I powered up it, laughing my head off at
the pirate signs (It's not a knitting club being my favourite...so
true!) and was just really really excited to see the pirates for
the first time, they didn't disappoint, with their big smiles and
cheers...legends!!<span>&nbsp;</span> Down to Southwell and was so
excited to see Mum and Dad... scanning and scanning all the crowds
and fantastic people cheering, turn right at the mini
roundabout..and there they are, YAY!!<span>&nbsp;</span> I REALLY
want a banana...my Dad is holding out a sandwich, I keep shouting
banana, banana!! but no banana appears, incredibly amusing, poor
Dad left holding a sandwich, and my Mum taking photos of me
shouting banana, love it!!<span>&nbsp;</span> No problems, was
amazing just to see them, and I'll get a banana at the next aid
station.<span>&nbsp;</span> At this point I should point out that
I'm eating Cliff shot bloxs every 30 mins, but my poor stomach is
not in a good mood, and every time I swallow them I puke them back
into my mouth (nice!) I force them down but it's not pleasant, at
one point some poor fella behind sees me puke half a chocolate mini
roll up onto the floor (sorry!).<span>&nbsp;</span> I get to the
next aid station...banana please!<span>&nbsp;</span> I fly past at
20mph and drop the banana, darn it!!<span>&nbsp;</span> Lesson
learnt!!<span>&nbsp;</span> Luckily the pirates save the day on
loop 2, not only do I get banana from them, but also banana from
Dad (he's well prepared this time) and even sandwich and banana
combo on the 3<sup>rd</sup> loop.<span>&nbsp;</span> My stomach
settled down about halfway round the bike course, and I then I knew
I would finish the bike.<span>&nbsp;</span> Many people, including
some of the really fast people gave lots of support on the bike
which was gratefully received, and I shouted as much encouragement
back as possible.<span>&nbsp;</span> With my lack of real
experience on the bike I didn't know how my legs would hold
up.<span>&nbsp;</span> I expected to average 14/14.5 mph, and
decided to just go at a pace I felt comfortable with, not looking
at my garmin except the check the general
time/distance.<span>&nbsp;</span> I realised I was going faster
than this, but as I felt comfortable would just go with
it.<span>&nbsp;</span> Coming in at 7.09 (15.6 mph average) and
well over half an hour faster than expected was
amazing.<span>&nbsp;</span> Mum and Dad cheering me into transition
gave me exactly the boost I needed to get those trainers on and out
onto the run.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In my
'dream plan' I was to run a 5 hour marathon, never did I ever
imagine I could do it (ok nearly 5 mins slower but I can cope with
that).<span>&nbsp;</span> It was hot on the run, and I knew I would
not be able to push as hard as maybe I would on a cooler day, and
had to be super aware of my hydration.<span>&nbsp;</span> I started
running, and although I felt a bit shattered my legs felt really
fresh...work that one out!<span>&nbsp;</span> I started running 10
min miles, which I was just happy to be able to sustain without any
discomfort.<span>&nbsp;</span> Walking though the aid stations and
stuffing my face with crisps, flat coke, water, oranges I was
happy, and even happier when I went through 6 miles in just over an
hour.<span>&nbsp;</span> My aim would be to run for as long as I
was able to, walk the aid stations, and hopefully only have to walk
the last few miles at worst.<span>&nbsp;</span> My Dad ran a few of
the river parts behind me, and also a bit of the
lake.<span>&nbsp;</span> This was lovely, and great to have him
there, but I felt awful that I couldn't really hold much (any)
conversation.<span>&nbsp;</span> I just had to concentrate and stay
in the zone to keep those legs turning over... but I think he
understood!<span>&nbsp;</span> There was so much amazing support on
the run, you couldn't help but feel humbled by it
all.<span>&nbsp;</span> I also had to run past the finishing chute
three times before it was eventually my time to turn down
there...some might say this is slightly cruel, but the cheers from
the grandstand were enough to lift the spirits, and watching others
finish gave me the boost I needed to keep
strong.<span>&nbsp;</span> On Lap 3 I really had to dig deep, but
instead of walking like I thought I might, I just kept at a steady
pace (12 min/miles).<span>&nbsp;</span> So with my determination
I'm now at the last turnaround point and I guess around three miles
to the finish.<span>&nbsp;</span> I say well done to every single
person I pass, and am smiling so much... I'm nearly
home!<span>&nbsp;</span> I round the lake for the final time, I can
hear the man and lady on the loudspeaker shouting everyone home...
name, you are an outlaw!<span>&nbsp;</span> I smile every time I
hear this, and all the other crazy stuff they are saying, I think
they even sing happy birthday to someone.<span>&nbsp;</span> I go
past many men walking on the last loop, and give them as much
encouragement as I can.<span>&nbsp;</span> As I get onto the final
straight I can hear the loudspeaker clearly again, someone has got
less than a minute to get under 14 hours... I can't be hearing
correctly, there's no way I've done it so fast, the loudspeaker
again, 'Well done, you did it in 13.59 something' oh my goodness, I
wasn't hearing things, I'm only a couple of minutes away
now.<span>&nbsp;</span> My Mum appears by the lake and starts
shouting that I'm her hero, she is so proud and I can't believe
I've nearly done it, I turn down the finishing chute and see my
Dad, we high five, and everyone else wants a high five too, it's
brilliant, I run down and lift the tape above my head and hear the
announcer JADE, YOU ARE AN
OUTLAW!!!!!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

network of friends following and supporting me from their homes or

really paid off.<span>&nbsp;</span> My time was amazing (for me),
and better than I could have ever imagined, but the best bit was
that I enjoyed every moment of it, and got to share it with some
very special people.<span>&nbsp;</span> When I finished it I said I
would never do it again, but my name already seems to be down for

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span>I was quite excited about this event, taming the Olympic
course and mixing with the stars so a couple of days before the
event I checked the web sites instructions on getting to the event.
The suggested travel method was to bring your folding bike by
train, cars should be avoided at all costs and buses would not
allow your folding bike on.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So I got
my trusty hacksaw out to cut up my bike and gaffer tape it back
together when I got to Hyde Park, as an afterthought i checked the
train time and the first train arrived a few minutes before my
start time and an hour after my registration time. Bums - there was
nothing for it, I would have to ignore their advice and come by
car.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Driving
through London at 4.00am is a strange experience watching people
crawling along the road but I managed to manoeuvre past the re
creation of zombie invasion to park outside Lancaster gate at
4.30am in a free parking zone - result - life is sweet.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>First to
register, first in to transition - this is looking good.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>3 hours
later! And I'm in the water, trying to ignore some strange American
on the loud speaker system - its lovely swimming in the Serpentine,
fortunately I could not see further than 2mm in front of my
goggles, but a lovely single loop swim - very weird as no one was
around and I did not see anyone for virtually the whole swim
because the course was so wide so I just got in to a steady rhythm
to the tune of 'I could be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky' as
recommended by David Walliams - it really works - try it, but I
could have gone faster if the likes of Rob, Steve and Dave were
around me for the swim as in the MSTC Olympic.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Out I pop
and limey it's a long run from the swim exit to T1 which was about
a km from the exit (the elites are about 10m from the water exit
which is much more civilised) - 3 minutes 51 sec later I arrived at
my bike (I was one of the quicker transitions, most were about 5-6
minutes). By eck I was knackered and my feet were sore by the time
I got on to the bike.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Ok this is
it and what I've been looking forward to, fast and flat and the
Olympic course - well first realisations it is not the Olympic
route taken by the elites (they kept that quite) it is totally
different although we do go past Buck House and it's not fast,
there are so many bends and corners (over 100 corners), speed
humps, bad surfaces, people on the course etc that it became a real
stop, stop, oops, ouch stop start affair, but i managed to get to
nearly 60kph past the barracks (just the once mind)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Half way
through the bike I hear my name shouted - bugger - wots up. Turned
round and Marc was pretending to be a Marshal on a notorious corner
that shall from now on be named Jordan's corner due the high number
of accidents on this particular greasy bend. I went on to lose at
least 5 seconds on each lap as I cheerily waved at what seemed to
be the only happy person in the centre of London at the
time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Good the
bike is over which turned out to be 42 point something km rather
than the perfectly measured course I expected <span>&nbsp;</span> -
no crashes, fillings are still in my mouth and I wasn't taken out
by a dog, tourist or slippery speed hump.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>After
another transition expedition I'm out on the run in the footsteps
of Brownlee et al - ur no not quite! The run follows a totally
different course in the opposite direction for four laps, well at
least it is flat - ur no not quite - a long drag up an incline for
about 1km before a short steep downhill, long flat bit, another
short sharp downhill then back to the grind uphill.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>By this
time I had done my usual of going out ok on the swim, flat out on
the bike racing some tattoo covered rough looking skinny chap who
was half my age and stuffing up the run. (The tattoo covered chap
ended up being the technical director of ITN news). So I struggled
through the run (which Emma Snowsill referred to as a school cross
country course) which finished nicely running up the blue carpet
where young Mr B finished a mere few hours later in a slightly
quicker time - and what nice chaps they are - they even had their
photo taken with me?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So
actually a thoroughly enjoyable day with a nice swim an interesting
ride and a hard run finished off with watching the world champs at
Jordan's corner with the man himself. I would recommend this race
even though it is quite expensive; it's not on in 2012 but is back
in 2013.</span></p>

<p><span>Only 6 hardy racers started the 50 this time. Dave Jones
would have made it 7 but hadn't checked his e-mail and was waiting
for a postal notification (which never came). When he saw how windy
it was outside he was probably quite pleased.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Being a 2
lap course the race was a game of 2 halves. James Dear sped round
the first lap in 59m00s with Lawrence Wintergold in hot pursuit
(59m11s). The second half is flatter because it misses out Tollgate
Hill, but the fatigue of racing 50 miles starts to creep in and the
times drift off. James' second lap was 60m27s, but Loz in his new
'Dear-stalker' hat manged 60m18s, just failing to catch James.
However he did have a mechanical incident to blame for it when his
chain got jammed and he had to remove the rear wheel to fix
it.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Further
down the field Dave Lashbrook and Rob Hoodless were doing battle.
Dave's first lap was 64m38s to Rob's 64m45s. Dave is clearly
recovering his fitness properly now because although he lost time
on his second lap (66m48s) he had more in the tank then Rob who
struggled and faded (68m10s) leaving Dave a clear 90 seconds ahead
at the finish.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Remarkably
there was another close battle going on between Steve Alden and
Rachel Baker. First lap times were very close with Rachel edging
it. She was 69m30s to Steve's 69m42s. Because Rachel started 9
minutes ahead Steve could see he was in grave danger of being
'chicked' and redoubled his effort on the second lap. He had the
most consistent times of the day doing the second lap just 17
seconds slower than the first in 69m59s while Rachel just faded
towards the end (71m40s) giving Steve the advantage by about 90
seconds. Rachel was the only one to do a PB though, whilst all the
others were several minutes down.</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Tuesday 23rd a group of highly trained MSTC athletes turn up at Weirwood reservoir for the inaugural Aquathlon. There were two races on offer the short 500m swim and a 5km run and the long 1km swim and a 7.5km run.

]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>After
initial banter race heads were put on and we went down to the
waters edge for the swim, long (2x500m laps) go first followed by
the short after 5 mins. The swim start was unusually sedate with no
washing machine as there were only 25 competitors in the whole
reservoir for the long and 20 for the short. That said I still had
to do battle with one guy who wanted to be where I was. Kay also
had to do battle as she and Fiona swam together for the exit
another lady decided she wanted Kay's line. I shall run some more
open water defence classes if anyone wants them.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Short
run out to T1 and out onto the run 3 laps or the long and 2 for the
short. For me it started good as it was on pavement but quickly
went off road through fields so each foot fall had to be carefully
placed that said it was still a nice run even with the stiles and
gates to climb over.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>3rd
lap and I am still out in the front I was 3<sup>rd</sup> out of the
water which gave me a comfortable lead over the other MSTC members
Steve B the closest at 2mins behind and Jon W 1.5 mins behind him I
knew it would be hard to hold them off. The last km and there he
is, the inevitable Steve has caught up so he trots along side for a
bit then disappears into the distance, I am now looking for Jon as
we are crossing a field I have a sense that their is someone behind
I look back and there is Jon trying to be as quite as possible so I
don't notice, I lift my pace but cant shake him, he
passes.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
finish line, we all congregate there and discover that the
unstoppable Fiona won the Short, only 3mins behind the male winner
and she had the fastest run of the day. Once she sorts her swim out
I think we may have a new Chrissie Wellington. Pippa comes across
the line as the first MSTC lady home for the long course. Rupert
puts in a sterling effort considering he is carrying a calf
injury.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>There is a club trophy up for winning, the first
3 in for their club will count as the first team in. Needless to
say with all the chat we all forgot about this and went for a
shower. East Grinstead and a few others waited around to the
muttering that they had won it, some chance that honour goes to Mid
Sussex Tri Club. Jon and I were in the shower when Pips burst into
the changing rooms shouting that we should get out quickly so half
dresses we stumbled up to the podium much to the disappointment of
the other clubs</span></span>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span>33 athletes took part in our second Middle Distance Race,
which was 8 up on last year. Race conditions were almost perfect
with the threatened early heavy rain not arriving. We had the usual
melee of getting transition erected, preparing to race etc. in
little more than an hour. But life is never straightforward and our
specially prepared racking did not fit properly. Luckily Del came
to the rescue, whipping out his tool in no time for a quick
bodge!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The second
problem was a distinct lack of timekeepers, after the 2 volunteers
had to pull out. David Ricketts had put himself down to swim and do
timing - all on Monday. Unfortunately the race was on Sunday! It
was his son's special 18<sup>th</sup> birthday lunch on the same
day. Brad came and started the timing but had a late offer to go to
Old Trafford for the football which I am sure made Rachel's husband
Paul very jealous. At the last second Tim Cresswell stepped in and
took it over, doing an excellent job in spite of being given a
watch that could only time up to one hour!!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Eventually
we had the race briefing. Pippa had to chuckle whenever she heard
the word 'mount' so I am not sure what sort of race she had in
mind, and Ant Grey was already prophetically planning an exit
strategy! Then 25 athletes jumped into the lake. It was our first
opportunity test out the new bouys. What a difference! Sighting was
a doddle. That was money very well spent.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>At Brad's
signal the race started. Mat Record stormed off as expected. The
swim course is probably longer than 1900m, the consensus was nearer
2100m in the end. Mat swam it in 34m15s, almost 4 minutes clear! He
even had time to stop at the pontoon to ask 'Where is
everybody?'</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The chasing
pack was led home by Mark Jordan and Dave Lashbrook, but also
included Colin Chambers and Steve Alden, who were as surprised to
be there as Mark and Dave were seeing them. Vaughan was not far
behind. He was in the pack but went wide at the far end and the
other four cut in with a better line and he then couldn't get back
on their feet.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Pipaa was
out first for the women in 40m49s with Hazel about 22 seconds down
with&nbsp;Rachel only 22 seconds minutes behind her. <span>Nikki
was&nbsp;2 minutes behind Rachel and guest Bethan 90 seconds
further back.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Through T1
and out onto the bike. Dave Lashbrook has clearly been listening to
Steve always talking about transition times as he blitzed through
ahead of the others. As expected though, the fastest bike split
went to James. His 2h22m04s (including transitions) was more than
14 minutes faster than anyone except for Rob Hoodless who was only
doing the bike leg. It shows how tough this bike course is that
only Rob and James broke 2h30m, and only 4 others even broke
2h40m.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There was
plenty going on out on the course though. Vaughan didn't fancy the
direction he was going so he turned round and was seen riding in
the opposite direction.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Mark and
Steve were having a good battle when Mark got stung by a wasp after
Balcombe on the first lap. Knowing he has potential anaphylaxis
problems he stopped to take some antihistamines, then quite rightly
stayed with Steve for the remainder of the ride, before pulling out
of the race in T2, when he didn't feel at all well. His actual ride
time of about 2h36m was astonishing in the circumstances, and he
was 24 minutes faster by T2 compared to last year.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Ant Grey
was trying some new techniques on the bike circuit. As it was hilly
he decided to shed some unnecessary components. He started by
losing his saddle, then his front wheel, and finally one pedal. The
weight saving strategy did not help, so he had to limp the bike
home via a shortened route. Paul Wills was also struggling after
coming out of the swim a bit disorientated. He gamely carried on
although he did need some advice on what to wear on the bike. Like
Ant and Mark though, he pulled out at T2.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The women
were far more sensible. Rachel quickly overtook Hazel on her way to
a bike split that was 20 minutes faster than any of the others.
Bethan, Hazel and Nikki all completed the bike within seven minutes
of each other and Hazel headed out on the run with a 10 minute
advantage over Bethan and Nikki. Jade decided to do a single lap of
both the bike and run, but it is only a few weeks since her very
impressive Ironman performance.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Although it
is essentially flat on the run, it is not an easy course. There are
5 dead turns, 14 gates to negotiate, a very uneven surface, some
short but marked inclines and lots of walkers, dogs and
mud.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>James
started the run with a 9 minute lead over Dave and 12 minutes over
Steve, who managed to bring the deficit down to 5m39s by the end,
and was delighted with a finish time under 5 hours, more than 13
minutes faster than last year. Dave eventually finished
4<sup>th</sup> as his legs were in trouble, but only finished 2
minutes down on last year and he was overtaken by Vaughan who was
running strongly. Pete tried to get a pace man to help him. His son
did a fine job and will probably be a good runner like his dad in
the future. Colin Chambers was clearly struggling on the run, with
leg problems. Stoically he put on a brave face and pushed on, and
gave everyone a good laugh at the finish when he stopped, laid down
and rolled over the finish line.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Del
Hastings put in another splendid performance to improve his last
year's time by more than 15 minutes.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Rachel was
able to cruise round the run with such a healthy lead, but it was
Bethan who was making the effort, and managed to overturn the 10
minute deficit on Hazel into a 6 minute advantage, to finish just
outside 6 hours. That was a great run. Fastest woman however was
Fiona in the relay with a 1h43m04s time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>11 people
took part in the relay, with David and Rob's team not having a
runner, which was a shame as they were comfortably in the lead at
that point. In the end the honours went to Mat, Phil and Richard
with a time of 5h24m, with the all ladies team of Pippa, Sharon and
Kay just 7 minutes behind. There were some superb individual
performances in the relay with Mat being the fastest swimmer, Rob -
second quickest cyclist and Fiona second quickest runner
overall.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The
performance of the day has to go to Trevor though. He was going
nicely until mid way through the run when his knees started to give
out. He could only walk and jog. He had the option to pull out
after 2 laps of the run, but carried on in a lot of trouble. He
easily got the biggest ovation of the day when he finished, and the
emotion of it was clearly on his face. But it was an amazing
effort.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>And when
everyone had finished there was the picnic going on. It was
fabulous that people like Phil Couch and Rupert Robinson who were
desperate to race themselves, but could not because of injury,
still turned up to be there and cheer everyone on. Lots of people
brought their families and there may well have been more than a
hundred people present altogether.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was nice
to have some guests racing, who I am certain will be future members
of the club. Good Luck to Charlie and Bethan in their big race -
Ironman Wales in a fortnight.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In the end
it was a great day for everyone! Well Done</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[One mans tale of triumph over apathy, poo and tooth decay.

 

]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was only
a training event and I had been feeling a bit poorly for the last
week so it took a bit of cajoling to make me put the bike and
wetsuit into the car as we went to see my folks in London. An
enjoyable and late evening did little to enhance my enthusiasm as
the alarm went off at 4am. Knowing that this was probably my best
chance to test my equipment and body before my "A" race (the
European Long Distance Championships) I reluctantly ate some toast
and marmalade as I made my way along the M25 and M1 to a gravel pit
in Milton Keynes.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Arriving at
the venue I sensed that this is one well organised event and at a
venue more attractive than I had anticipated. There was plenty of
parking and plenty of loos. Massage tents, sponsor signs and
transition areas were well marked out. Best of all were the giant
(at least 20 feet high!) inflatable runner and cyclist that signal
the way out of transition.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>As the sun
started to warm the air the first wave of 350 were under way. Being
either a lady or an old git meant I had an extra 30 mins to decide
what excuses I had either not to start or pack early on. Failing to
think of anything I joined the 350 other athletes in my wave to
waddle through the goose poo to the start area. The starter waited
until I was facing the wrong way clearing my goggles to sound the
start hooter. The water was surprisingly warm and unsurprisingly
busy. I do not enjoy mass starts and took my customary place near
the back and way off course. This would not usually have been a
problem but the dry weather meant that my belly grounded several
times and I had a bit of a tussle with some reeds.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Transition
was a lame affair and poor Steve would be turning in his grave were
he not alive and kicking. The bike course was a mix of delightful
single carriageway and slightly less pleasant (but quite quick)
dual carriageway. There were 2 and a ½ undulating laps were I
managed to overhaul most of the fast swimmers.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Making sure
I took a handful of chocolate éclairs - my current favourite energy
source - I exited transition in an equally poor fashion to be
astounded by the fact I could run. I mean <span>proper</span>
running and not the Ironman plod I had been expecting. The run
course was 4 laps of a mostly off road circuit with a couple of
hills. Had I known it I was in Gold medal position coming off the
bike (for my age group) but I am not sure I could have matched the
1.25 the eventual winner managed. I am also not sure if the
accidental filling extraction hindered or helped me but I have made
a note to go for something less toffee based next time. Still I was
delighted with the 1.30 I did.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Through the
finish area I found plenty of fruit, energy gels and water. By now
it had become quite hot so I joined an increasing number of
overcooked competitors in the lake to reflect on a great morning
out.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It is a
pity the other 2 Mid-Sussex crew did not make it as this is a super
half. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to do a well organised
but not overly challenging event.</span></p>

<p><span>Having developed a passion for open air swimming at
Tooting Bec Lido and trained with many swimmers whilst they
prepared for long distance events, one big swim had been on their
'rite of passage' - Lake Windermere.<span>&nbsp;</span> A
stretching 10.5 miles in England's longest lake..not to mention the
cold factor.<span>&nbsp;</span> I felt that this was a step up from
my Channel relay (2007) - I wasn't to be disappointed.</span></p>

<p><span>So training began in earnest with Mid Sussex
Marlins.<span>&nbsp;</span> I upped my usual twice weekly sessions
to three at Easter and started sea swimming in
mid-May.<span>&nbsp;</span> The first outing was an 80 minute
session in 12 degree water and waves the size of
houses.<span>&nbsp;</span> I knew from then on it would be a tough
training regime.<span>&nbsp;</span> Other swims followed - Shoreham
to Brighton (8km), various 5km races, several circular Brighton
swims, a 7km session at Pells Pool and a 9.2km session at Tooting
Bec Lido.<span>&nbsp;</span> In August I also started to catch a
5.30am ride up to Tooting Bec to increase my weekday outdoor
mileage.<span>&nbsp;</span> I was starting to get fit!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Race day
loomed and I had a mild coronary trying to gather my crew together
to row me up the lake - my thanks to many of you who
volunteered.<span>&nbsp;</span> Steve Mac and Tim Creswell signed
up with an evening curry to discuss strategy and
tactics.<span>&nbsp;</span> I'm not sure what Steve thought when he
asked about my feeding strategy..in honesty I didn't have
one!<span>&nbsp;</span> Thank god Steve knows what he's talking
about on sports nutrition matters.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So we
convened at Euston station before a 4 hour journey took us to the
Lake District, our hotel (for blind people!) checked into and off
to Bowness for the last supper.<span>&nbsp;</span> Not sure if the
calming Peroni was a good idea but the lasagne was
perfect.<span>&nbsp;</span> Lights out was midnight and I started
hearing the rain fall outside at about 4am.<span>&nbsp;</span> I
knew the weather was going to be grim the next day.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>We convened
for breakfast at 6.45am (with a group of very fit looking Irish
swimmers) before a taxi to the start line.<span>&nbsp;</span> Our
driver pointed out a few landmarks along the way as the rain teamed
down.<span>&nbsp;</span> We registered, cleverly borrowing some
safety gear I'd forgotten from some Windermere veterans, before
crews, then swimmers were briefed.<span>&nbsp;</span> Our old
wooden rowing boat was loaded and I made my way to the start
recognising a good few people from other swims I'd done...and
triathlons!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The water
was certainly brisk when I lowered myself in from the jetty (16°c)
and within 90 seconds the gun went off.<span>&nbsp;</span> It was
9.25am and we were swimming.<span>&nbsp;</span> I could see a lead
group make quick progress and we rendezvoused with our crews after
about ½ a mile.<span>&nbsp;</span> The rain was coming down and I
could see Steve and Tim in their waterproofs.<span>&nbsp;</span>
The 15 mph wind was pushing the boats along quickly and it was a
job keeping up with them (or rather them slowing down for
me!).<span>&nbsp;</span> My stroke felt strong and the cold wasn't
a noticeable factor.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was
shame I couldn't see the mountain tops but I was gradually eating
up the shoreline, even starting to recognise a few
milestones.<span>&nbsp;</span> The first feed stop saw my diet of
an energy gel, lucozade sport and the odd banana whilst treading
water beside the boat - this was tough and I often drifted
off.<span>&nbsp;</span> I fed every 30 minutes and by the end I
could hit Steve or Tim with my bottle and empty gel from 10
yards!<span>&nbsp;</span> After 2 hours I'd reached a childhood
landmark and knew I was 6km into the swim.<span>&nbsp;</span> My
stroke still felt good.<span>&nbsp;</span> The boys were getting
damper by the minute and they took turns rowing and feeding me,
with Steve urging me to up my stroke...little did he know I was
going at the max and couldn't change pace even if a shark had been
on my tail!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The fun
really started at 3 hours.<span>&nbsp;</span> I knew I was only
midway and by this stage Steve had started feeding me 500ml of
double strength carbohydrate drink and the odd chocolate
roll.<span>&nbsp;</span> Luckily it was made with warm water as
when I stopped I was noticeably shivering.<span>&nbsp;</span> We
picked some choice places to stop - directly in front on the
incoming Hawkshead ferry and beside a large, extremely cold stream
that was running in to the lake.<span>&nbsp;</span> The cold was
getting to my crew's brains too!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The scenery
along the length of Windermere is very
picturesque.<span>&nbsp;</span> I had hoped to see the peaks and
steep valley sides, watch people on the lake in sailing boats and
shirt-sleeves.<span>&nbsp;</span> All I got was low cloud,
incessant rain, moderate wind, a few marshals in ribs and empty
water. <span>&nbsp;</span> It wasn't the prettiest day but we did
swim through some lovely water - the group of islands we navigated
through, superb clarity of water, some short weedy sections, flat
water &amp; wavey water, times when I contoured the shore and saw
the bottom.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So I ate
into the miles and was starting to feel that I would make
it.<span>&nbsp;</span> Truthfully I never had any doubt that I
wouldn't but by 4.5 hours I was getting bored and apparently a
little blue on the lips/chin and shoulders (didn't feel it
though).<span>&nbsp;</span> I was getting 30 minute reports on how
far to go from the marshals who seemed to pay us quite a few visits
and at 5.5 hours I could finally see the finish - maybe 8-10 small
white houses.<span>&nbsp;</span> The finish line was near but by
now my stroke was feeling a lot more "deconstructed" - it was as
though I was swimming catch-up drill and was sitting low in the
water. The only thing I knew would correct this was to go hard, so
for the next 45 mins I did up my stroke and
power.<span>&nbsp;</span> I had a good line into the finish and,
although it did feel as though I swam my slowest single kilometre
ever, I could see the jetty and
finish.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Suddenly I
looked right and saw an umbrella-wielding figure sat on a deckchair
on the jetty - she blew a loud blast on her whistle and I was
done.<span>&nbsp;</span> I had reached Waterhead/Ambleside in 6
hours 32 mins and swam the 10.5 miles (17km) from Fell Foot in
south Windermere.<span>&nbsp;</span> I swam 25m to the shore and
took a final celebratory pee in the lake.<span>&nbsp;</span> I
staggered over to the admin tent to shelter from the continuing
rain and let Steve and Tim get me dressed.<span>&nbsp;</span> I
knew I would be cold and had to warm up fast so we went into the
next door pub before I had hot water and hot
chocolate.<span>&nbsp;</span> Once they'd put down their
well-earned pints I gave Steve and Tim a huge hug and spoke to
Michelle to tell her I'd made it. <span>&nbsp;</span> Chips,
pasties, rum/coke and fine red wine were to follow!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It's only
when you stop that you get the chance to rationalise
everything.<span>&nbsp;</span> I'd spent 4 months in training to
swim England's longest lake in Speedos.<span>&nbsp;</span> As I sat
in the pub warming up the tears in my eyes were a reflection of the
effort a huge team had put in to get me to the finish - my family,
the swimming clubs at Haywards Heath and Tooting, the tri club,
hardy swimmers I keep in touch with, people I met at events who
gave me advice.<span>&nbsp;</span> Everybody helped and I thank all
of them. <span>&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span>Some stat-o type
facts</span></strong><span>:<span>&nbsp;</span> I consumed 4198
calories but expended 6000+ calories during the swim - probably
around 10,000 throughout the day.<span>&nbsp;</span> I never moved
my googles once throughout the swim because they never steamed
up.<span>&nbsp;</span> The winner took 3 hours 50 mins, which was 3
minutes outside the record.<span>&nbsp;</span> 28 swimmers started,
26 finished.<span>&nbsp;</span> And finally, the only time it
stopped raining on the day was when we arrived at the station to go
home..</span></p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span>After entering on the day and looking out at the grey
choppy sea and grey sky I was thinking 'hmmm is this a good idea' I
had also had the thought of doing the 2km swim rather than the 1km
, but stuck to the 1km as it was the BAR event... I'm very glad I
did.... There were surprisingly few club members present, although
I know a some people were off marshalling for Olympic preparation
events. In fact there weren't that many people entered at all...a
lot of DNS maybe because of the weather.</span></p>

<p><span>So it was left to Colin, Andrew, Jules and me to share out
the points.. Jules being very happy she was&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;10
points and wanting to know how much of the swim she actually had to
do to get them!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I wasn't at
last year's event which I had heard a lot about; especially the
strong current against you on the return leg and the choppy waves
making it a lot lot harder than it should have been. So I was
mentally prepared for a struggle on the way back. The start was a
run into the waves and out to a buoy before turning round it and
West. I dived in a bit early as after a quite a few strokes I
noticed Jules was still bounding through the waves beside me! I
must learn that dolphin diving technique for going through
waves...anyway I got behind Colin and drafted him to the buoy ,
everything ok so far and then round the buoy and I had no idea
where Colin was anymore. There are more important things on my
mind, such as the waves being a lot bigger than they looked like
from the shore. I found the out leg really hard, with the waves
picking me up and throwing me down... at one point I was feeling
quite sea sick due to the swell and the amount of water I was
swallowing. So I stopped bilateral and just breathed on the one
side which was better as I took on less water. At one point a wave
just left my arms flailing out of the water and just left me static
trying to spot anyone else above the waves to see where to
go.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>At this
point I was still thinking that the return leg was going to be
worse. I hadn't yet worked out the current was going the other way
from last year. My joy at not having entered the 2km was lost in a
struggle to survive the waves. Finally I spotted the turn around
buoy and headed back and everything became a lot easier! The waves
were now carrying me along with them and I really started to shift,
a wonderful feeling after the battle outwards! So I regained my
form and chased down a swimmer ahead and suddenly there was the
finish. Navigating round the groynes I sprinted up the beach with
encouragement from Colin to run... once a triathlete always a
triathlete! He later told me I overtook 3 people from the water
edge to the finish line :) thats 2 more than I did in the
swim.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So all 4 of
us finished and I think we all found it a struggle, I know Jules
and Andrew did, Colin maybe less as he came in 8th overall! The
times were surprisingly fast, at least I think mine is ...last time
I swam a 1km sea swim it was 18 mins and that was one direction
with the current, this time it was 15 mins which I find hard to
believe given the battle outwards but I assume they got it
right!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So the
1,2,3 of MTSC men was Colin (8th), Trevor(20th) and Andrew(25th)
and Jules(34th) was 1st woman :)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Writing
this now I'm tempted to say it was a great swim , its amazing what
the human mind is capable of forgetting, as really I found it
pretty hellish. Halfway through I was seriously thinking I might
not be able to finish the event if the return leg was going to be
the same or worse as the outwards leg. Thank you for letting me
forget how bad it was... bring on the next one!</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[If you had told me 3 years ago that I would be on the start line  of the European Long Distance Triathlon Championships wearing a GBR tri-suit I would have told you that you may have overdosed on performance enhancing but brain befuddling "supplements".]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span>A
fabulous Finnish finish</span></strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>If you had
told me 3 years ago that I would be on the start
line<span>&nbsp;</span> of the European Long Distance Triathlon
Championships wearing a GBR tri-suit I would have told you that you
may have overdosed on performance enhancing but brain befuddling
"supplements". But there I was, feeling something of an imposter,
amongst Europe's finest age group and pro athletes, pondering quite
how deep the "deep water" start was going to be and if someone was
suddenly going to let me know my selection was an unfortunate
clerical oversight.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>When I was
offered a place on the team in February (you get a "Congratulations
you have been selected e-mail") I looked up the weather in Tampere,
Finland, where the race was to be held. -20c by day didn't look
great and the 160cm of ice on the lake seemed to suggest skating
drills should replace swimming ones.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Luckily
there was no ice to break as the starter ordered us into the water.
Whilst the balmy water temperature (19.6c) was comforting, the
thought of a 4km out and back swim was rather scary to a landlubber
like myself. When the team GBR race recce took place the team
manager pointed out into the far distance beyond the horizon line..
"and somewhere out there is the turn buoy". Luckily my customary
swim start tactics left me with plenty of feet (well all of them
actually) to follow. I managed to find some kind of rhythm and
sensed I was heading in the right kind of direction. This was
confirmed as the leading age group ladies caught up and swam over
the top of me.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Whilst the
woman on top wearing rubber water play fantasy may be some people's
idea of fun I didn't take too well to this assault. My survival
instincts must have kicked in and I swallowed several gallons of
Finland's finest lake water to act as ballast and enable me to
remain submerged whilst the girls tap danced on my head.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I must have
swum round the buoy at some stage as I could see the footbridge
near the Olympic Stadium HQ where transition was. With great relief
I hauled myself unglamorously out of the water happy to be alive
and not experiencing the dreaded cramps that have reduced me to
tears in the past. I was further uplifted by the cheers of support
from team Wintergold (Daisy, Daniel, Alice and her parents had all
come out too).</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The bike
leg was a confusing 6 lap effort that included lots of well
marshalled roads, a section of motorway and a scalextric style
cross over where you went from being on the left side of the road
to the right with on-coming riders doing the opposite.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I was
making quite good progress but couldn't push too hard or drink as
my stomach was complaining about the small pond ingested during my
encounter with the fast ladies. By lap 3 this pond was trying to
make a bid for freedom sometimes up, sometimes down and sometimes
both. Not wanting to break the strict ETU rules on revealing
various bits of anatomy and not wanting to soil my new trisuit I
skidded (no, not that kind of skid) to a halt outside the stadium.
"Where's the loo?" I shouted at the congregated mass of spectators
and officials. Various shrugs and looks of confusion suggested that
my lack of Finnish ("missa on vessa", if you ever need to know) and
coherency made me look rather</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I decided
to head into the stadium and search the myriad of corridors for the
room I was increasingly desperate to locate. The combination of
shiny floors and cycling cleats is not good. Add in a dose of panic
and the dramatic backflip with double twist was inevitable. Picking
myself from the floor I spied the facilities required and some 7
minutes later I emerged from the stygian gloom to remount my bike
several kilos lighter. The next 3 laps were more comfortable in
spite of the rising wind and the continuing game of Russian

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Going into
T2 it was lovely to hear "Go Daddy go" as the Wintergold
cheerleaders made their presence heard. A leisurely transition (not
forgetting a handful of chocolate éclairs for comfort and energy)
and it was off on the scenic 4 lap lakeside run. It was quickly
apparent that I had forgotten to pack my running legs so I settled
into a 7'50 mile plod and cheered the other GBR athletes as we
crossed paths (but not in the Scalextric manner of the bike course
thankfully). The pro athletes were simply amazing and were already
approaching the last of their 20 miles at a pace I could only dream
of.</span></p>

<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Every lap
the family fan club gave me a boost as I tried to keep the numbers
of people passing me level with the numbers of people I passed. A
helpful Finnish age grouper swapped an éclair for details of the
(totally unmarked and off course) loos. The slightly lighter load
meant I picked up to a heady 7'49 mile pace and rewarded his
kindness by overtaking him with a mile to go.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was a
really special to finish (and not in last place as I had feared) in
an Olympic stadium in front of your own family.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>A lovely
holiday followed where I could spend some quality time with them
and not my wetsuit. The lakes and sea were fabulous as were the Spy
Museum and the Viking Feast. A better post race celebration would
have been hard to find.</span></p>

of you dreaming of wearing GBR on your front I say keep on trying
and keep on training - eventually you will be so old that you will
get there!</span></p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span>Hi guys&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 After a 5 hour drive I arrived at registration on Saturday in the
pouring hard rain and wind!!! Welcome to Wales!!! Once i had
registered i thought i would check out the swim course. Standing
looking at this huge expanse of water, which resembled the Atlantic
Ocean with white horses everywhere, i asked the guy next to me "
where is the lake we will be swimming in?" He looked at me and
laughed and said, "that's it there!" Oh shit, i thought let's hope
the weather&nbsp;changes by tomorrow!!! Well it did!</span></p>

<p><span>Sunday morning arrived and the weather had changed, but
for the worse, more rain and stronger winds!!!
At&nbsp;&nbsp;09.30hrs i watched the first wave go off and within a
few minutes people were being pulled out of the water, very
encouraging!!!! The next few waves were the same as swimmers were
struggling against the elements!! Now it was time for my wave, with
my heart in my boots, well in my feet, i made my way down the
slippery slope and into the freezing cold water!! The first 750
metres was going to be&nbsp;out against the wind and some guy stood
next to me said," you will need to swim fast otherwise you will
make no headway". "Thanks mate", I said, " but i don't do fast
swimming!" "Oh well, best of luck then", he said. By now the wind
was so strong the waves looked like the side of houses and you
could hardly see the marker buoys and i was bloody
freezing!!&nbsp;10.00hrs and &nbsp;the hooter goes and we are off.
Trying to get into some sort of rhythm i found almost impossible
due to the waves, every time i tried to sight i was smacked in the
face with what i saw was a huge wall of water!! Eventually after
what felt like hours i made it to what i thought was the turnround
buoy, only to be told by one of the rescue boats that it wasn't!!!
I had to dig really deep at this point as i was feeling very cold
and i knew i was struggling. From somewhere i found the self
motivation to crack on and eventually i reached the REAL turnround
bouy!!! I thought the 750 metre swim back was going to be easier
with the wind behind but i found i was still struggling against the
elements! After what felt like hours i could see the finish of the
swim and remembered that we had been warned of the very rocky
approach to the slipway. Suddenly a very friendly arm pulled me up
out of the water and said " well done mate", i then managed a sort
of run into&nbsp;T1 and was cheered on by the crowd and i heard the
race commentator say i had taken 52 mins but i had done it!!!! I
then had problems getting my wet suit off as i was so cold but at
least the rain had stopped. After about 6 mins i was ready to leave
transition. The bike&nbsp;leg was an undulating out and back
course, on closed roads,&nbsp;and the first 12.5 miles was against
the wind which was so strong that it was like cycling against a
brick wall!!!&nbsp;By the time&nbsp;i had got to the turnround
point i had overhauled several riders and on the return leg was
able to make up more ground with the wind behind me. Arriving in T2
i decided to shed my thin long sleeve top i had put on for the bike
as the sun, yes the SUN, was breaking through the clouds!!After
1min 35secs in T2 i was off on the run which was&nbsp;a 10k out and
back undulating course&nbsp;on closed roads&nbsp;and, although the
first half was against the still strong wind, i managed to overtake
a few more&nbsp;and eventually crossed the finish
line!!!</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Well guys. I have one under my belt at last. 
Steve Mac asked me to write a "race report", so here is something I circulated to my family after the longest racing experience of my life.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span>An early start having racked the day before, at
Fordingbridge,&nbsp;and overnighted at a friend's house. Alarm at
4.15am for breakfast and then a drive to the fabulously named
"Sandy Balls Holiday Camp" to park up and take a bus transfer to T1
and the lake.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Standing by the lake at 6.30am, I was
questioning my sanity but at 7.10 we (old farts)&nbsp;followed Wave
1 (Quick Men &amp; Ladies) into the water which was surprisingly
warm (unlike Hever last year which was surprisingly freezing!) and
at 7.22am we were off for a 1.9k swim. It all went well and I
enjoyed myself. I estimate that I was about 35/36 mins for the swim
but T1 was a bit of a mare as I got caught up trying to put dry kit
on a wet body but my splits show 42 mins for Swim + T1. There was a
bit of a run out to the road which was partly on mats but then on
mud/sand which was okay except my Shimano cycle cleats clogged up
and wouldn't clip to my pedals. Off the bike, clean the cleats,
back on the bike and not happy.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>The bike was more hilly than I expected
and why is it all the flat stretches appear to be into a head wind?
Perhaps I was travelling very fast (!) (wise up Andy, the time says
otherwise). Great scenery with plenty of wildlife - horses, ponies,
donkeys, cattle - and a lovely moment when a bull wandered out in
front of me causing a slalom avoidance manoeuvre that had fellow
cyclists applauding my cycling agility - but that was about all
there was to applaud.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>On reflection I found the bike tough (very
undulating with little remission from climbing) and despite
covering more than this distance regularly in training with Jeff
&amp; Peter&nbsp;- at about mile 45 the quad cramps started and it
was &nbsp;almost the Sussex Sportive all over again! So I pulled
back on the speed and nursed my legs to the finish and after 56
miles it was a relief to get off the bike and dump it in
T2.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Into the tent, off with the cycle kit and
deep joy to pull on the trainers for the run. My split shows 3.32

 class="MsoNormal"><span>A cross country half marathon is very
different to my usual road races and I found it tough, especially
with my thighs in shreds. Fortunately, I teamed up - at about mile
7 - with 2 other runners having similar fun, to see each other to
the end. The final hill nearly killed me and my quads were spasming
(quite odd to watch) but after 2.40 (an hour longer than my average
half marathon time) I crossed the line and never has a chair been
so welcoming.</span></p>

during the most negative parts of the bike course - when I was
unsure how much further there was to cycle, when my legs were
killing me, when I started to think there was no way of running 13
miles and when I just wanted to give up - that there is a part of
me that refuses to give in. I was not going to let all that
training go to waste, I was not going to tell everyone I'd achieved
a DNF and, more importantly, I was not going to let myself

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[It seems like i have only just written one report but here i go again!!
 
To all my avid readers, this will be the last time, this year, that you will have to put up with my literacy skills as this was my final triathlon of the season. ]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I won't bore you with details of my "extremely long" journey
from South Chailey to Brighton as it was uneventfull and by 06.15 i
was parked right opposite the start point.The weather was good the
sky looked pretty clear and the sun would soon be out. I spent the
next hour setting up my gear in transition and chatting to other
competitors. I even found myself giving advise to a very nervous
guy about the swim leg! Yes ME giving advise about swimming!!! Well
actually it was more about trying to reassure him to try to
alleviate his nerves!!</p>

<p>I still find it hard to believe that i have reached a point in
my triathlon career where the swim leg no longer presents a mental
problem, i just wish i could move quicker through the water, then i
will really have cracked it!!!</p>

<p>There were two "waves", the first, all males under 40yrs, the
second, all males over 40yrs and all the females. The 1000m swim
leg takes place in the Inner Marina, so the water is brackish and
fairly still. At least i didn't have to fight the waves and the
wind like in Wales!!! As i got into the water my nose clip broke,
which in the past would have really "pissed" me off because without
a nose clip i suffer after a swim with a severely congested nose,
but being a real triathlete i ignored the issue!!! as soon as the
hooter sounded i was off and into my rhythm albeit a slow one!! The
swim went without any problems and the next thing i am climbing the
ladder, yes climbing a ladder, to get out of the water, then it is
a 200m run through the Marina shopping precinct on pavement and
road back to T1.</p>

<p>No problems this time in getting my wet suit off and i was soon
off on the two lap 32K bike course which takes you out of the
Marina heading towards the roundabout at St. Dunstans where the
route then goes up through Ovingdean and continues to climb up to
Woodingdean. After climbing the short but steep ramp at the lights
it then heads towards the race course where it turns left and down
Wilson Avenue,[over 40mph down here but you have to careful at the
bottom that you slow in time for left turn at the lights] then
behind the golf course for the start of the second lap. By now
although it was a bit cloudy the sun was warming up. During the two
bike laps i managed to overtake a number of other riders so by the
time i reached T2 i had made up some of the time i always lose on
the swim.</p>

<p>No problems in T2 and then it was an 8K out and back run along
the underpass towards Rottingdean. the sun was quite warm now but
there was a nice breeze coming off the sea.On the way out i
overtook a few runners and the return leg i even managed to up my
pace and passed a couple more before "sprinting" to the finish
line. Although by now my nose was pretty blocked up i enjoyed my
last triathlon of this season.<br />

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Abingdon Marathon. Sunday, 16 October, 2011.
Flat course, mild weather and bare-foot running helped take nearly 12 mins off PB.
VLM good-for-age time finally achieved !!!!!!!]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I thoroughly recommend this race, which is well organised and
has less than 800 runners (so not enough people to get in the way).
Well marshalled plus decent medal and a technical shirt in the
goodie-bag.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
 Vibram Five-Fingers in training allowed Asics Piranha SP3 shoes to
be used for the marathon. The Piranha's weigh 140g each (half the
weight of normal marathon shoes) and are considered best for
distances up to 5k. By running on the balls of feet there is no
need for the heel cushioning but it does stress the calf
muscles.</p>

<p>Abingdon Ranked Top in UK For PBs in 2010 Runners World
Poll.</p>

<p>This is the first marathon I have ever done "with negative
splits". 1:36 out and 1:34 back. Wonderful feeling finishing
strongly and being able to sprint the last few hundred metres in an
Athletics Stadium to the finish line. All my previous marathon
efforts have ended in wall-hit near-death experiences as I crawl
over the finish line, having slowed dramatically over the last few
miles. Pleasant 10 degrees weather helped.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[It was another great turnout for Barns Green with 17 athletes making the start line. In typical Barns Green fashion though, the drizzle started before the race, then turned into heavier rain throughout. By the finish there was no real opportunity to get a team photo as everyone started to get wet and cold. On a positive note it was quite mild before the start.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>The pre-race favourite was always James, and he stormed off at
the start. Jim Graham has been concentrating on his running and he
also started very strongly. I am not noted for fast starts but went
through the first mile in 6m23s, but James and Jim were already way
out of sight, probably well under 6 minutes!! Soon after Phil Couch
came cantering past looking very comfortable.</p>

<p>Colin went out fairly quickly, and was followed by Mark and
Rachel who were being paced by Rob, who was barely at a jogging
pace by his standards, whilst making Rachel and Mark run at their
limit!</p>

<p>With Barns Green it is always the second half of the race that
sorts everyone out as somehow it seems to be predominantly uphill,
especially after 9 miles. By the half way mark though we already
had two casualties. Clare had to pull out with cramp, which was
very disappointing for her, and Emma stopped halfway. Her 6-month
taper for this race had left her severely undertrained!</p>

<p>By 9 miles James had run into trouble. He was on course for a
1h23m finish when he developed severe stomach cramps. He gamely
carried on, running and walking to still finish just outside 1h33m.
Meanwhile Jim Graham kept up his excellent pace to be first home in
1.26.19. Phil could just see him at times but could not close the
gap to finish in 1.27.12. Steve was delighted to run a very even
race in 1.28.18.</p>

<p>Once Mark had got his breathing together he managed to push on
to finish 14 seconds ahead of Rachel and Rob, but not before all
three had caught and passed Colin late on. He wasn't wearing club
kit and it was only the muttered expletives that made them realise
they had overtaken him!&nbsp; Rachel broke her PB by some 4 minutes
so had a cracking run. John Liebers ran in place of Steve Mac
(apparently worried that 14 pints of lager the night before might
have an adverse effect) and did a time Steve would have been proud
of - just outside 1h46m and a few minutes ahead of Del who did a
respectable 1h52m.</p>

<p>Lucy had an excellent run to finish second lady in 1.46.30, and
Kay planned and executed a very steady even race in 2h10m and Julie
did an excellent 2.08.56 (?PB). I didn't even see Sharon in the
melee afterward but she was third lady from the club just outside
2h6m. Julienne finished in 2h34m.</p>

<p>No race would be complete without the support crew so thanks to
Steve Mac (and Murphy), Hazel and Pete for their consistent
cheering.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[A BIKE ride is to be held around the Haywards Heath town boundary next week. 

]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ride organised by Haywards Heath councillor Richard Bates is
an opportunity to explore a circular on road route around the
town's boundary - known as its Bounds.</p>

<p>The ride will start at 10am from Haywards Heath Town Hall on
Saturday, November 26, followed by a coffee break and a discussion
from 11am.</p>

<p>The discussion can be anything you wish to raise about cycling
locally and it is intended to respond to the Neighbourhood Plan

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>At the end of my first season in Triathlon, I convinced myself
that I had one race left in me - and so I signed up on the day for
the Chilly Duathlon at Castle Coombe race track in Wiltshire. It
seemed like a great idea with a 2 mile run, 10 mile cycle, and back
for another 2 miles running. The course was on the Castle Coombe
motor racing circuit - which at 2 miles in length, made the maths
easy for the organisers.</p>

<p>I got there early, and was able to blag a quick lap of the track
on my bike before they set up. Low lying fog quickly turned my
cycling glasses in to a blurry waste of £15 - so they got binned
into my kit bag when I got back to rack my bike. A good move as
others would find later.</p>

<p>A quick briefing later, and a stern talking to from the BTF
official about drafting (where everyone was given their first
warning), we were sent off in a mass start. Starting at the back
(as I thought I was a slow runner) meant that my ego got a boost as
I quickly started passing other competitors. Towards the end of my
2 mile run, the leaders were already completing their first bike
lap and envy propelled me into T1. Sodding shoe wouldn't come off -
wasted 10s, got on the bike - forgot that I left it in a high gear
after my test lap, another few secs wasted - and we're off on lap 1
- smile for the camera on exit.</p>

<p>5 laps later, my legs are still good and T2 seemed to go better.
Ripped the top off a gel, and promptly sent most of it over my
hands. Started the 2 mile run with sticky fingers - nice. Anyway, I
stuck to my race plan and reeled in some more runners - and even
caught the two guys that I thought had left me for dust in the
first run. A final sprint for the line and home for tea and medals
(no t-shirt).</p>

<p>Overall the race was really well organised with chip timing and
lots of sponsors on site selling their wares. I'll be back next
year.</p>

<p><span>While Barns Green is well known for its wind and rain, it
seems that the Brighton 10k is usually bright and sunny. This year
was no exception making superb racing conditions.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Of course
this wasn't enough for some, with Rob, Rachel and Claire electing
to cycle down for the race. Altogether 15 MSTC athletes were
running although there may be others who did not enter as MSTC. For
the first time more women than men from the club were racing (8 v
7).</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Those who
have raced here before know that it is quite a boring course but it
is pretty flat and therefore quite fast. However now that there are
2700 runners it is getting a bit crowded!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>We actually
had 2 MSTC athletes right at the front of the field, with both Mark
Jordan and Callum Murray riding mountain bikes to keep the road
clear for the leading runners, although Mark was having some
trouble blowing his whistle and shouting at the same
time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Steve
Crocker showed the pace that has been evident on Thursday evenings
to be first home in 38.39. He still felt he went off too fast and
that he could go faster if he paced himself better. Not a bad
effort for his first club race though. Steve Alden was not far
behind with his quickest 10k for 6 years in 39.16. Rob Hoodless
faded a bit at the end but just crept in under the 40 minutes in
39.58.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Rachel was
first lady home from the club with a comfortable PB in 43.48.
Second was Tamsin in 47.18 although she felt she could have run
faster. She has been training well so I am sure her times will come
down.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I didn't
see Dave Leadbitter but he ran well to finish in 45.03, comfortably
ahead of Colin (46.17) and Steve Mac in 46.38. Peter Clarke
completed the men in 49.13.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Julie
Williams continued her good form with a PB in 56.08 to finish
3<sup>rd</sup> lady with Kay Mac in 57.24. A very hot and thirsty
Claire finished in 64.23. There are no drinks stations around the
course and on a warm day she really suffered. Jules got round in
65.27 nearly a minute behind Emma (64.36) who lost a BAR point by
starting too far back. Rose Ryan had a gentle run round in 75.49
encouraging another runner.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Rob and
Rachel then cycled home with Callum and Mark but not before
stopping in Ditchling for tea and cakes - the best conclusion to a
social ride!</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[The final BAR race of the season brought out 8 hardy MSTC athletes for a bitterly cold Marathon race on the coast of Portsmouth.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span>The final race of the season brought out 8 hardy athletes
for a bitterly cold race on the coast. Good preparation does not
prevent all problems however and Rob was fighting off a sore
throat, whilst Steve was recovering from a gastric flu bug which
hit just 8 days before the race, leaving him unable to eat for 4
days. Medical advice suggests it is not good to race in those
circumstances. What do those doctors know anyway?</span></p>

<p><span>Most race organisers understand the 'smell of fear'
concept. For those who don't I would not suggest going near any
nearby toilets just before a race. This race was the exception,
there were virtually no toilets. In fact it turned out there were
more massage ladies available after the race than toilets
beforehand. That didn't stop Kev, who was into the ladies like a
shot when the opportunity arose, barging desperate women out of the
way to shed a few pounds before the start. The rest of us looked
elsewhere and found a toilet block, but the cold water feed had
frozen so there was no flush! Did we give up and look elsewhere -
NO - stack it high, flush later! I can only imagine how bad it
got.</span></p>

<p><span>The race got underway at 9.30, with the air temperature
still below zero. The course is about as pancake flat as it is
possible to be, but for all that this was a tough race. One third
of the course was pavement or tarmac, one third was gravel tracks
which were not too bad apart from the puddles, and the other third
was downright cross country. It was those sections which made it
hard. There was mud, narrow slippery wet paths, rock strewn paths,
shingle beach sections, and grass and large puddles. You could get
back up to speed on the good bits only to have another strength
sapping section to knock you right back. In addition there were no
marshals except at the (very good) feed stations. When you are
tired it is too easy just to follow the person in front, and whilst
it was generally easy to follow the course there were odd sections
where it was easy to go wrong. I don't think any of us got round
without errors. Jim certainly went wrong about 4 miles from the
finish, and there was one section where the entire field went
wrong. A steep path on this section finished at a river edge with a
4 metre drop into the water. I wasn't expecting it and had to pull
up sharply to avoid going over the edge. The race times illustrated
how challenging it actually was. Only 8 people finished under 3
hours.</span></p>

<p><span>Jim, Steve and Kev stayed together for about 4 miles but
then Jim pushed up the pace and dropped the others. By the half way
mark he had a good minute advantage over Steve, who was as far
ahead of Kev. Rob decided to pace Rachel round because of his bug
and Emma was taking the race at a sensible pace whilst Kay and
Julienne were going along steadily.</span></p>

<p><span>The views and terrain of this race were quite amazing and
I can quite understand why it was voted in the Top 10 of 'must do'
marathons in the UK. There were marinas and harbours, marshlands
and parklands, rivers and estuaries as well as the seafront views.
However when it comes to the second half it becomes apparent that
most of the view is a patch of ground just a few feet ahead of you
as the fatigue starts to set in, pain starts to intrude and the
real challenge of marathon running hits home.</span></p>

<p><span>Jim was probably the only one who wasn't feeling it too
badly. He always looked strong and powered through to finish
29<sup>th</sup> just under 3h15m. Steve did get Jim back in his
sights at about 22 miles, but then an old problem with his right
knee suddenly triggered. It was like turning a switch from running
strongly to being in severe pain and virtually being unable to put
the right foot to the floor. This led to a comical running action
of lightly stepping on the right foot and doing an exaggerated left
stride to try to keep the pace up. It worked after a fashion but
cost him 30 seconds a mile. Frustratingly it cost him a few places,
including the second lady who was being dragged round by what
appeared to be a husky! He was still delighted with 38<sup>th</sup>
place and a 3h17m finish, and can only imagine what he could have
done without the bug during the previous week.</span></p>

<p><span>It turned out Kev had dropped back for a reason. He has
done 3 marathons this year and was very well prepared and fit.
Sometimes however you just know it is not going to be your day, and
this was such an occasion. He realised he was struggling and
sensibly backed off in the second half to finish in just under
3h34m, still a very respectable time.</span></p>

<p><span>Rob and Rachel continued running together for most of the
way, although Rob did find the cold weather and constant reminders
of water a bit too much for his bladder, resulting in him stopping
three times! Rachel however was running superbly and was on target
to be way under her PB. Similar to me though, she suddenly hit
problems at about 22 miles and from then on was really struggling.
Nevertheless she remained a full 5 minutes inside her PB at the
finish for an excellent time just under 3h46m. Rob, gentleman that
he is(!) did manage to get a time 3 seconds faster, although
clearly he didn't really get out of the comfort zone all the way
round, and he even included his comfort breaks. They even managed
to befriend an odd bloke called Dave!</span></p>

<p><span>Emma was running a steady pace and thought she might be
able to break 4hrs. Her PB is 3h51m but it was 10 years ago so sub
4 would have been quite a feat. Like Rachel and Steve she also ran
into problems late on and really suffered. She even went through a
phase of wondering if she would finish at all but soldiered on for
a 4h11m finish. As a training race for her true goal of the
Brighton Marathon in April though, this was an excellent
performance.</span></p>

<p><span>Kay got into trouble with a stitch relatively early.
Clearly that makes proper running almost impossible so she had to
resort to power walking and jogging. Husband Steve was trying to
support her by riding round the route on his mountain bike, but
wandered off somewhere towards Chichester and had to return to base
to wait for her there. She finished, still smiling and cheerful, in
5h25m, probably looking in better shape than the rest of
us.</span></p>

<p><span>Julienne had her usual steady pace. I did feel quite sorry
for Darren at the finish, waiting in the freezing cold. On a
positive note he always knew how she was doing because of the
stream of text updates. She finished in 5h48m which I have huge
respect for because it is an awful long time to be out there
working hard.</span></p>

<p><span>Once we had finished most of us had a massage from the
'Pompey Pummellers' - I have to say it was the most painful
post-race massage I have ever had, and easily the most effective
one. She found every knot - although it felt like it was all knot
with a bit of leg underneath. The difference it makes is
staggering. The next day you can walk virtually normally -
incredible!</span></p>

<p><span>Special praise must go to Tim and Claire who came to
support, and stood out in the cold along with Darren and Steve Mac.
However painful it is doing this sort of race I always prefer to be
taking part rather than watching, if only for that sense of relief
and achievement at the finish.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>So what kind
of year was 2011 - I can reveal to you that it is the year of the
Twisted Warped Absent Minded Triathlete. For those who are poor at
mnemonics that is T.W.A.T - TWAT.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>By our very
nature others consider us somewhat twisted and warped - what other
part of society wakes itself up before sunrise to smear itself in
cold grease, dress in rubber, share a communal (and often less than
perfectly formed number ) in a pungently perfumed plastic prison
with no loo roll and then throws themselves into a guano infested
swamp?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>What marks
out this year is the additional and exceptional degree of absent
mindedness displayed by some of our seemingly sharp sportsmen and
women.</span></p>

after award,The Golden Buttocks</strong> prize is given for success
in the realm of romance and since the retirement of Andy
"snakehips" Heath there has been little action in the Mid Sussex
bedroom department.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>However for
one amazing and astonishing moment I thought we had the most
unlikely of twisted and warped winners.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Already a
married man and holding a high station in our esteemed organisation
I was rather worried about Steve Mac when I heard he was getting
together with an old flame - perhaps he hd forgotten he had a
wife?.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Poor Mrs
Mac, how must she feel - probably quite relieved given his high
levels of testosterone.<span>&nbsp;</span> Happily it turns out it
was my hearing again and in fact he is going to get together with
the Olympic Flame.<span>&nbsp;</span> So no golden buttocks this
year .but then a glimmer of hope from another unexpected
source...</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>My anonymous
source, Rob Hoodless, indiscreetly told me that he had seen one
other of our married elders, Steve Alden, getting hot and steamy
with a bit of beaver action. More amazingly he told me he had
gotten great pleasure from watching!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Whilst I was
obviously repulsed by this thought I had to ask for more details
(in the interest of this prize category of course) and maybe some
photographic evidence (to add to my extensive personal
collection).</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Rob looked a
bit perplexed as he explained to me that I had gotten the wrong
bushy creature beginning with b and it was a bit of
<span>badger</span> action.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>It seems
that this keen duo were practicing their time trial skills with Rob
given the job of catching Steve over 25 miles who had been given a
head start..</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Steve
"trains like a snail races like a hare" Alden was just about to get
overtaken by Rob when an unfortunate bit of two tone roadkill found
its way in his path</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Always one
to take the shortest route Steve had no hesitation in slicing the
poor creature in 2 and leave Rob with an entrail facepack. Whilst
this was a rather warped incident it was not the kind to win the
prestigious Golden Buttocks so I am afraid dear friends we must
keep this award locked up in the vaults of Jordan
Mansions.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">

the passionate triathlete. He spent much of the East Grinstead

suited to a teenage ladyboy than an octogenarian athlete.
Forgetting entirely that he is a bloke (and one who is old enough
to know better) he had the audacity to outdo twinkly Trev in a
fetching illuminated angel outfit. So please step forward

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>The Wobbler
- a man of little physical talent and boundless forgetfulness
managed to snap his chain half way up Leith Hill and being rather
absent minded had forgotten his chainlink tool. Sadly Kev, Ian
Anderson and I were equally absent minded and we we spent the rest
of the day pushing this ungainly lump around the South and North
Downs in search of a bike shop. Not quite enough to earn a golden
spanner though.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Steve Mac a
man of impeccable appearance (apart from tonight obviously) is
rather particular about colour coordination and had invested in
some some nice orange bar tape to match his David Dickinson
permatan.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Someone who
reveals their flesh as much as he does needs to ensure they have an
even all over tan and Steve has been known to resort to the bottle
during the colder months - not the alcoholic kind of bottle as he
is almost totally abstinent (apart from tonight again it would
seem) but the self tanning kind of bottle.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>As he left
the Dolphin on the handlebar tapes first outing he realised with
horror that there was a terrible clash in the tango tone of his
tape and his tan. Sensing immediate ridicule he decided to kick his
chain off through vigorous abuse of his gear levers and took the
opportunity to coat his hands and tape in a mucky but matching
shade of chainoil black</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>However
these 2 puny attempts were severely outclassed by this evenings
winner. A man who makes a habit of forgetting to check his bike
over and even when he does forgets what he should be looking for,
he excelled himself at the club half ironman.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Maybe he was
under the impression that the half referred to the amount of bike
that should arrive back at T2. And how he managed such a feat we
will never really know but Ant Grey managed to get his bike under
the BTA weight limit between T1 and T2 arriving with half the usual
number of pedals and 100% less than the usual number of saddles.
For this outstanding feat of mechanical ineptitude he clearly
deserves the golden spanner.</span></p>

added a 4<sup>th</sup> discipline to the triathlon - gymnastics.
The double back somersault with half twist as he took his bike off
his car roof rack at the Cambridge duathlon earned him some
admiring looks but not from the unfortunate girl he landed on. In
spite of the cracked ribs that resulted he still he qualified for
GB age group (unlike the flattened female) so I guess he hadn't
quite given his all to the proper challenge of the ARSE</span></p>

is a man who is all for sex equality - he wants to get as much as
Emma gets. However, his principles are easily overcome and this was
evident at the last Crawley Wheelers 25 where he was starting just
ahead of Rachel. Concerned that this might be the day he got
chicked he reached the first roundabout and hurled himself off the
bike causing great bruising to himself and a few holes to his skin
suit but miraculously (or not) no damage to his rather expensive
and cosseted bike. Watch out though Steve she promises to get you
this year.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>The hilly
100 mile cyclosportive was probably too much for most of the men
here and the terrain too challenging and technical but that didn't
stop our heroine from taking the Meatloaf "Bat out of Hell"
approach to descending. Yes the downhill was steep, yes it was
covered in horse poo and gravel, yes it was twisty and littered
with feeble men who were shattered from the previous 85 arduous
miles but it really does not explain why Jean Fish absent mindedly
forgot to use her brakes rather than her body to slow her descent.
Gallantly, my informant, Sharon the compassionate, listened to the
crash occuring nearby and pedalled on oblivious to her comrades
demise.</span></p>

joined the GBR team for a spot of international competition out at
Pontevedra. Our absent minded age grouper was feeling very pleased
with herself as the race progressed. Not only was she cruising past
the other "f" age groupers she had the distinct impression she had
aged much better than most! Anyway it wasn't till well after the
event had finished that she realised that the 'F' mark on the
ladies legs meant Female as opposed to being our age group

Water Attempts Terminated.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>You may now
have gathered that the recipient of our final award is our open
water sewage swallowing superhero, <strong>Jamie
Goodhead</strong>..</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Before I
outline his noble non completion of his cut price attempts at a
foreign holiday I must congratulate his wife on setting a target
and completing it with a magnificent marathon time and no
misfortune.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>But it must
be admitted that swimming the channel is rather a complex and
extreme matter and his first failed attempt really was quite
unfortunate as one of the team manning the accompanying support
boat had a cardiovascular accident half way across and the swim was
terminated for a first time . Happily he survived as did Jamies
ambitions.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Now what
happened on the second attempt is more of a mystery. It would seem
the adverse wind conditions that thwarted our gluttonous glory
seeker were more of the meteorological kind than the carboloading
induced sort.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Surely it
would be a case of 3<sup>rd</sup> time lucky. It certainly seemed
that way as he entered Calais harbour after 19 (yes 19) hours of
swimming. However the cold and extreme toil on his magnificent
physique but pitiful brain were all too much and lead him to become
rather confused and absent minded.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>In spite of
his crews determination to get him to believe he only had 100
metres to go and that he was just about to complete his ultimate
challenge, he entirely forgot himself and terminated his own
attempt by stepping onto the boat.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>So tonights
PRIZE TWAT wins his award more because of his Three Water Attempts
Terminated than his final act of absent mindedness.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>He also wins
my undying admiration and I hope that I stand here next year to
tell you of his successful crossing and to award him the Channel
Urges Now Terminated award (and I wont tell you what that
spells).</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>Please step
forward Jamie .......</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="Standard"><span>That brings
us to the end of my summary of the year of the RAT so it just
remains for me to thank you for attention and thank those that have
ably assisted me tonight</span></p>

style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Greater mutual respect between motorists
and cyclists will make the road a safer place to ride a bike.
That's the clear message from British Cycling, the National
Governing Body which oversees all aspects of cycling, in a summary
of findings published today based on feedback received from its
members on road safety matters.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Among the potential solutions highlighted
to make mutual respect a reality were to include greater cycle
awareness in the driving test and Highway Code, ensure better
enforcement of the law on mobile phone use while driving, and
improve poorly laid out roads and junctions which pose a danger
particularly to inexperienced cyclists.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Ian Drake, Chief Executive of British
Cycling, said: "As more people take to their bikes, we take
seriously our responsibility to ensure they are able to do so in a
safe environment. The reality is that the number of cycling deaths
and injuries on the roads is decreasing and evidence suggests that
the more people who cycle, the safer it becomes. However, for us,
even one death is one too many and by listening to our members we
can better understand what needs to be done to help create the
necessary mutual respect required between motorists and cyclists to
ensure both can use the roads in a safe
manner.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>"It's essential that we get away from this
sense of 'them and us' between motorists and cyclists. Most people
who ride a bike also drive a car which suggests there should
already be some mutual understanding. Now more needs to be done to
build on this and create culture in which all road users can better
respect each other. And it's important to stress that cyclists have
as much of a role to play in this as motorists, by ensuring they
adhere to the rules of the road with regards to things like
stopping at red traffic lights and signalling
correctly."</span></p>

Cycling include:</span></p>

<span>In terms of greater cycle awareness in driving tests, the two
areas highlighted for particular attention were that drivers should
know how to overtake cyclists safely, and how much space to allow
cyclists.</span></li>

<li class="MsoNormal"
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">
<span>With regards to road layouts, the most common complaint was
about cycle lanes that end too abruptly.</span></li>

<li class="MsoNormal"
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">
<span>As well as the compulsory introduction of improved mirrors to
reduce blind spots on HGVs, it was widely felt that better
education for drivers to ensure they look out for cyclists and
better education for cyclists about the risks of cycling on the
inside of HGV would help reduce the risk of HGV-related
accidents.</span></li>

<li class="MsoNormal"
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">
<span>The reduction of urban speed limits from 30mph to 20mph would
reduce the</span> <span>severity of injuries sustained in any
accidents, although it was acknowledged that drivers might become
agitated if they had to drive at that speed.</span></li>

Co-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Cycling Group, said: "I'm
very pleased to see British Cycling, of which I have been a member
for many years, making its voice heard in this sphere and I look
forward to playing my part in Westminster to get the changes
needed."</span></p>

style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>The findings were also welcomed by Rob
Gifford, Executive Director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council
for Transport Safety, who said: "This is very consistent with what
we know about how best to further improve road safety and I think
that the overall theme that measures should promote mutual respect
and understanding between road users is exactly right."</span></p>

<p

 class="MsoNormal"><span>Working closely with its legal partner,
Leigh Day, and other key stakeholders, British Cycling will take
forward the views of its members to influence politicians and
policy makers to make cycling safer. This has already begun with
engagement with the Transport Minister and all the London Mayoral
candidates on the key issues,.</span></p>

 class="MsoNormal"><span>Nicole Cooke, Olympic Road Race Champion,
said: "We know that personal safety, and the perceived risks
associated with cycling, can be a barrier to getting on a bike,
especially amongst women. If we want to continue to see
participation grow we need to address this and make tangible
changes to ensure the roads are safer for cyclists. Through greater
respect we can ensure more people can enjoy riding a bike which has
got to be a good thing to strive towards particularly in the year
of a home Olympic and Paralympic Games."</span></p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span><span><strong><span>The Results:</span></strong> A top class
international field produced a marathon winning time of 2:08 with
21 runners doing 2:18 or less. Any one of those would have won the
Brighton marathon. The top 50 runners were finished by 2:45 and
they were virtually all from Ethiopia , Kenya and Morocco. Jim
Graham was the 98<sup>th</sup> man (the 4<sup>th</sup> British male
runner) by finishing in 3:11, just a few seconds outside of
PB.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span>The half-marathon race started 30 minutes before the marathon
and the winning time was a sensational 1:01:59. Helen Graham was
the 359<sup>th</sup> woman home in 2:17 (including time spent in a
mid-race comfort break) which is MSTC best half-marathon time of
the year (so far).&nbsp;</span> <span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span>The web-sites and results on the internet are mostly in
French, so it is a bit tricky to work it all out. Race numbers went
to around 7,000 but that seemed to combine half-marathon and
marathon. Therefore, the event is tiny compared to London Marathon
and about half the size of Brighton Marathon. There appear to have
been fewer than 700 marathon finishers with the majority of runners
doing the half-marathon.</span> <span></span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span> <span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span><span><strong><span>The experience:</span></strong> The
easyjet flights and transfers from Gatwick to the superb hotel "les
Jardins de la Koutoubia" were a doddle (<span><a
href="http://www.lesjardinsdelakoutoubia.com/"
target="_blank"><span>www.lesjardinsdelakoutoubia.com</span></a></span>).</span></span>
<span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span>We chose to organise the trip and race entry ourselves rather
than use one of the marathon tour companies. As a result we paid
the same in total but got a much better hotel that was just half a
mile walking distance from the race start/finish. Collecting race
numbers the day before from the expo was easy and great fun as it
coincided with a kids race that day.</span> <span></span></p>

Arc" and "Carry on Follow that Camel". Shouldn't have been such a
culture shock because Carry-on-Follow-that-Camel was filmed on
Littlehampton beach. Like Littlehampton, Marrakech feels like
it&nbsp;hasn't changed much for centuries (except the horse-drawn
carts in Marrakech have rubber tyres now). There was plenty of
exhaust fumes from 2-stroke mopeds to remind one this is the
21<sup>st</sup> century.</span> <span></span></p>

<span>Following the race we had a swim in the hotel pool then a
nice wander in the Marrakech Souk (markets a few hundred yards from
the hotel). Within minutes we had got live snakes wrapped around
our necks and were being demanded to pay money for the privilege.
Mayhem. It was frantic and amazing doing a little shopping for
souvenirs.</span> <span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="yiv496078740msonormal">
<span>The race was different with no energy drinks but just bottled
water at irregular intervals (carry your own bottle I suggest). No
energy gels but oranges, dates, figs&nbsp;and raisins on offer. The
middle of the marathon had a 5-mile section with no feed stations
and running through busy city roads competing with traffic and
pedestrians. It is actually possible to get lost even though the
runner in front is just a few metres away. The road closures get a
bit less well enforced once the elite runners have gone through
(I'd have had those Ethiopian Olympic Team runners
otherwise..honest). However, the course is flat and has no annoying
hairpins or switch backs so definite PB potential. The temperature
was a&nbsp;pleasant 13-15 degrees during the race&nbsp;plus there
was some shade from palm-trees and the ancient city walls.</span>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[A bright and sunny perfect running day met the be-vested men and ladies weeing into the sea and the MSTC runners at the famous Brighton Half Marathon, famous for its windy and wet weather and this year famous for being a half and a bit marathon.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>As
usual there were a couple of pantomime horses at the front which
must have taken at least 2-3 minutes of every ones times as the
runners attempted to get past and skidded on the manure, another PB
slips away in the first few minutes.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There was
a strange orange lady running that looked like she had drunk some
special Orange fizzy drink from Willy Wonkers chocolate factory,
expanded in strange places and changed colour</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Jade
(who was not orange) lavished in the sun shine, it was a beautiful
day, and she really enjoyed 'racing' a fast
course.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Steve Mac
also had a great race and felt very comfortable all the way round
until about mile 10 when allegedly Saturdays bike ride came back to
pay a visit, a quick stretch (he did not say where) and by mile 11
it was all ok again.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Jade set
off steadily increasing her pace and surprised herself when she
smashed her previous best time (that was previously well over 2
hours!) and even managed a negative split</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Steve was
running in his new MSTC running vest and<span>&nbsp;</span>
appeared to be missing 2 nipples at the end and has customised his
vest with red go faster streaks</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Well done
to Andy who was quite surprised at his result with a stupendous
1.21.53 and third in his age group he says that despite being 53,
it just goes to show that by laying off the alcohol, abstaining
from sex and only eating fruit, it really can turn a man from being
a cart horse plodder, who in previous years has only achieved a PB
of 1:39, into a testosterone crazed athlete capable of dramatically
improving his performance by 18 minutes.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Colin
tried to hide from all the MSTC runners to save being taken down in
the final minutes fortunately Steve Mac did not spot him but Martin
did a sterling effort to chase him to the line
crossing<span>&nbsp;</span> just a few places behind. Colin would
have gone faster but slipped on Steve's nipples (not for the first
time) as they rolled across the road in search of the orange lady
(in a kind of cathodic way)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The
general consensus from the throng of disgruntled sweaty athletes
moaning as as they crossed the line is that ½ mile was added on to
the course (700m by my and others Garmins), which meant most had
run slower than they thought they should have. The organisers have
amended the race results to try and reflect this but not correctly
and most agree that the calculations are wrong and additional time
should be taken off the final results.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Colin (in
his very boring nerdy way) believes that at least 3min 40secs
should have been deducted from his original time as he was running
an average of just under 7.20min miles, where only 2m 20 was
deducted, so he is going to take of an additional 1:20 it all helps
so all should give themselves a proper adjusted time by deducting
half of a one mile pace from the original time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Jim and
Martin would benefit from the Colin rule of taking of extra time
time to give exceptional PBs as will Helen who did a stonking PB,
Jade, Jean and Steve also PB'd which were most deserved with Jim
doing<span>&nbsp;</span> a spectacular 1.25.01 which should be
amended to sub 1.25 and Martin about 1.36</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Steve Mac
smashed his PB by nearly 7 mins to show that level pacing and
steady Heart Rate really do work and for the first time felt like
he could have carried on for a few more miles. If there was a prize
for the biggest PB smash then maybe Steve and Jade are in the
running.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Jade
reckons it is a great course, great day, fun atmosphere and great
results all round, terrible organisation but won't dwell on any
negatives, no<span>&nbsp;</span> bumping into the boobtastic Miss
Price so an all round good day!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>And a big
cheer for the support from MSTC spectators inc Claire and Tim who
have had their loyalty cards stamped - five more spectator
sightings and they get a big sweaty club hug.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>After a
very short millisecond Andy honourably fessed up that he was not a
turbo charged whippet capable of creaming the opposition and
smashing younger club runners into the middle of next week, he was
ill on the day and one of Steve Macs new pace makers had taken his
place. Although if its there in print it's hard for the 'race time
denialist' to argue as Colin knows with his 2.03 London Triathlon
certificate which takes pride of place on his wall.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So it was
all a bit Pee Bee City on the seafront with about eight noted and
sorry if your PB has not been mentioned especially as they may be
more PB's with the statutory Colin adjustment</span></p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>A perfect morning, bright sunshine, 12
degrees, 5 knots of wind, no rain for two days, and a midday start
to allow for a lie in. It all seemed so civilised.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>I arrived at the Castle Coombe race track
nice and early to rack my bike in a good position and sensed a
change in the air from the November race. The average value of
bikes seemed to be around the £3,000 mark with some very slick
looking machines whose wheels alone probably cost that. Something
was very different. A van pulled up next to me, and out jumped last
years winner who kindly informed me that with the national
championships looming, every serious duathlete in the area was
using this as a warm-up event - my hopes of finishing in the top
half were rapidly diminishing.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Time for some positive thinking - I still
had a PB to beat, and a sneaky look around the paddock confirmed
that the guy who beat me by 6 seconds last time was here
again..</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>My pre race plan had me starting in the
middle of the pack (rather than at the back), in the hope I would
pick a faster pace for the first 2 miles. Off goes the gun and my
plan is working well with only one tiny flaw. The pack last time
did not include 200 duathletes wanting to compete in the national
championships. Lungs burning, vision blurring I manage half a mile
before backing off to a more sensible pace. My rival comes past me
at the mile mark - but I keep the gap to 20 metres as we go into
T1.</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p
style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"
 class="MsoNormal"><span>Out onto the track and I start reeling in
some of those quick runners. The bike feels great on the road after
a winter on the turbo trainer and my pace feels good. I go past my
rival on lap 2, and in I go after lap 5 (10 miles) for T2. The ##*#
next to me has kicked my running shoes out of position when he
racked his bike - but transition practice works a treat and we are

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Sunday 12 February 2012, Great Walstead School</p>

<p>Still not sure how the three of us got persuaded into doing our
first cyclo cross event; something to do with Steve Mac thinking it
would be a good idea to have a team representing the Mid Sussex Tri
Club and we just happened to be in the wrong place at the right
time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mark Smith from the Crawley Wheelers kindly showed us the course
the day before, which really helped familiarise ourselves with the
snow, ice, mud, tight corners, Dougie's dip and the odd tree
stump!&nbsp; The only thing missing was the other one hundred and
thirty two riders.</p>

<p>Morning of the race dawned bright but very cold - oh, what to
wear! So we layered up, with me trying to match my colours - which
in the end didn't matter as we were all a lovely mud colour by the
end. Andy and I arrived with plenty of time to spare, to calm the
nerves, which got worse when we saw how professional the other guys
were looking, on their cyclo cross bikes and skin suits. I decided
to break the reflectors off my mountain bike, in a desperate
attempt to fit in. One team member even had a bell on his bike.</p>

<p>Oh, but where was our third team member? A thermos of soup in
hand, Mat turned up 30mins before the start, all smiles until we
pointed out it might be a good idea to familiarise himself with the
course, so off we dashed to the woods.</p>

<p>There we found Steve, Kay, Tim and an old man under a blanket,
which turned out to be Kevin trying to keep warm. They did a grand
job of lap counting. Off dashed Andy and Matt to recce the course
with 15 minutes to go.&nbsp; Five to go...where are they?&nbsp;
Round the bend they appear with Mat stripping off, so Andy and I
make our way down to the start and position ourselves at the back
of the of riders. One minute to go, where is Mat? On the phone to
his wife giving directions to the event before a swift handover to
Dougie who finished off his conversation! 30 seconds to start
..where are my team members? Peeing in the bushes! Beware of yellow
snow.</p>

<p>We're off and any nerves have now disappeared as we head round a
field covered in snow, desperately trying to stay on our bikes as
by now the route is really slippy. Into the woods and we try to
navigate a load of hair pin bends which lead us into our first drop
followed by a sharp turn to the right up a quick climb into more
bends. We twist and turn on snow and mud until we get to a great
little downhill bit, were we could pick up some speed and smile at
Ant who was taking some great pictures.</p>

<p>Right hand bend and we are at Dougies dip, for me this was the
best bit, straight into the drop no brakes and the speed carries
you out the other side, just missing the tree on your right. I
think I even got some 'air'! Round the corner someone leaves a tree
across the path!&nbsp; Off the bike, carry it over the tree, back
on and we're on the home straight and then do it all again
(x4).</p>

<p>The course was really technical and made all the more fun by
overtaking riders, very slippery conditions (rumour has it Mat fell
off three times!), trackside bonfires and Tour de France style
drums and tooters!&nbsp; A great day out and a huge recommendation
to others.</p>

<p>For the three of us, being our first cyclo cross event, it was
fantastic fun, made all the better with the support from the club,
the sight of all those familiar faces spurned us on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jean Fish, Andy Jenkins and Mat Record</p>

A group for all those interested in Triathlon events, both in and
around Brighton, the BTRS Training Series has been set up to offer
a set of FREE 'race conditioned' sessions to help you with your
training. There are absolutely no costs for these events.<br />
<br />
2011 was a successful season for all involved with the series and
we would like to thank you all for being part of a fantastic
Journey. With many new strengths discovered, new limits passed and
new friends made it was a fantastic year that culminated in
Novembers half Ironman challenge. The event was a tough day for all
involved and for those who had the courage to take it on we would
like to congratulate you for what you have achieved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our '2011 end of series' award night was also a great success, with
recognition and awards handed out to our athletes for some
exceptional performances. The evening raffle helped raised funds to
support our local athlete, Sophia Warner who will be representing
Great Britain in the 2012 Olympics.<br />
<br />
We're excited about taking things forward in 2012, so with this in
mind may I wish you all an awesome start to the new year race
season. We're looking forward to welcoming new athletes into our

<p>Where do i begin? When i first got the email informing me that i
had been selected to represent GB i just could not believe it! So i
sent the BTF an email asking if they had made a mistake!! NO they
said we haven't!!</p>

<p><br />
 I arrived in Eilat via Tel Aviv on Weds. 18.4.12. On the coach
between airports in Tel Aviv i saw a sign for Jerusalem, it made me
think of all those thousands of years of biblical history.</p>

<p><br />
 Wednesday was basically a free day after putting my bike together
and setting it up. There was a swim recce at 17.00 and most people
swam without a wetsuit as the water temperature was 21c. Most
people after the swim were discussing the pros and cons of wearing
a wetsuit.</p>

<p><br />
 Thursday and it's my BIRTHDAY!! Up early and out on the road at
06.00 to recce the bike course. Good road surface but very windy
and open, lots of steep inclines on the way out. On the way back
the traffic was starting to build up, luckily on race day the roads
will be closed. Once back at the hotel it was out again to walk and
jog 1 x lap of the run course. Only one incline which was on the
way out of T2 against the wind, otherwise a flat course mainly on
tarmac surface and gravel track. Then it was back to the hotel
again for breakfast. At 09.00 it was registration time, then at
16.00 it was the race briefing and team photo. 17.00 it was bike,
helmet and race kit check and racking of the bike in T1. I let some
air out the tyres so that they didn't explode in the heat
overnight!</p>

<p><br />
 It was all sinking in now, the enormity of what 1 would be taking
part in. It was time then for the evening meal, plenty of
pasta!!</p>

<p><br />
 It's Friday RACE DAY!!! Up at 05.00 and had two pots of porridge
that i had taken out with me [good old Tesco ] At 06.00 i made my
way to transition, luckily i was staying in the Team Hotel which
was only 5 mins. walk.</p>

<p><br />
 Once in T1 pumped up my tyres and laid out my kit. By now i had
made the decision to wear a wetsuit for the swim. Obviously NOT for
the BIKE and RUN!!!!&nbsp;<br />
 The majority of the age groupers had also decided on a wetsuit as
the water temperature had dropped a few degrees. The organisers
were very strict about what you could leave in transition, any
excess clothes, track pump etc. had to be placed in a bag in an
adjacent hotel. We had to leave transition by 07.00 with our
wetsuits half on and make our way to the swim area approximately
400m away.</p>

<p><br />
 At the swim start there were huge crowds and music playing over
the loud speakers, great atmosphere. At 07.50 our wave was called
forward and you had to line up on this long matting that was laid
out on the beach. Suddenly the music stopped and all you could hear
was this really LOUD heartbeat over the speakers. As if i wasn't
nervous enough!! Then on your MARKS and then the claxon. We're
off!!!</p>

<p><br />
 We had been advised before the swim that there was a strong
current moving from left to right so kept to the left side of the
pack. I managed to keep a pretty good line out to the turn around
buoys even though the water was a bit choppy and then it was back
to the beach and the swim exit. The run from there to T1 was hard
on the feet even though they had put matting down covering most of
the tarmac surface.</p>

<p><br />
 My T1 time was a bit slow due to the run from swim exit and taking
off the wetsuit. It was another 50m run with the bike to the mount
line, then it was down on the tri-bars and go!!!</p>

<p><br />
 The ride out to the turnround point was extremely hard against a
very strong wind and undulating inclines, average speed out was
between 14 and 16 mph!!! The return leg was fantastic with the wind
behind and averaging 30mph. Heading towards the finish of the bike
i removed my feet from my shoes and performed a good dismount!!
&nbsp;[ i had been practising at home in the local school
playground !!! ]</p>

<p><br />
 Into T2 a quick turnaround and out on the run, the first 500m was
up an incline against the wind and then settled into my pace.The
run was 4 x laps and by now the it was pretty hot but i dug in and
even managed a faster last lap.&nbsp;<br />
 What an amazing feeling as you run up the blue carpet towards the
finish gantry and you hear your name called out over the loud
speakers and the crowds are cheering!! I've got a lump in my throat
just writing about it!!!</p>

<p><br />
 I may not have won a medal but i did bust a gut trying!!!</p>

<p><br />

<span><span><span>It wasn't an easy race in which to score your

weather.</span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span>James Dear, who joined the club as a cyclist,
also based his second place on a storming run, a 20.23, the fastest

recent health problems. Just think what he can do when he's fully
recovered.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">The race was held
on Sunday 29th, at the Dolphin Leisure Centre Haywards Heath and
MSTC were well represented with 12 competitors. Club members did
fantastically well, with Fiona Bussell winning the Women's event
and James Dear coming second in the Men's. With Ant Grey's 10th,
Phil Couch's 8th and Lawence Wintergold's 7th, MSTC took 4 of the
top 10 places.&nbsp; Competitors were greeted with strong winds and
heavy rain, and this was the first time I have laid my kit out in
the pouring rain! The bike was getting soaked and I carefully laid
my kit out in a giant Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Carrier bag.
As I left it, secured by my front wheel, I wondered which end of
the car park I might find it when I emerged from the pool. This was
my 3rd Tri and I looked on at my more experienced competitors, with
their heavy duty water tight giant tupperware boxes, grinning at me
whilst they put their gear in. Not to worry, the smiles and support
from the fantastic MSTC marshals restored my confidence. The pre
race briefing was excellent and we were told we had three
policemen, with marshals, patrolling the 3 right hand turns on the
bike course, with a "foot-down" instruction at the mini roundabout
right turn by the Dolphin pub.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I noted 96 competitors made it to the start, from an original
starting line up of 131, which goes to prove that not all
tri-athletes are daft. In the pool we had the luxury of a 32m&nbsp;
length, just 12 lengths for a total swim of just under 400m. Oddly
we entered at the opposite end from the pool emergency exit, which
meant a 32m "walk" down the pool length before exiting. Running
poolside was band, so competitors had to walk. I watched in
amusement as early competitors tried to get away with "lifting" ,
the incidence of which increased with the increasing competitor
number. I did try and "feel" the water in my swim as "Coach Jones"
tells me, but the water was having none of it, so I fought it all
the way. Out of the pool I gave an outrageous demonstration of
"lifting" , got away with it, but on exit I was totally
disorientated by all the bike park, the layout looked very
different from the pool exit. I spotted my giant blue carrier bag,
which to my relief was still on the floor and not up a tree, and it
was sitting by my bike which looked a lot cleaner than when I last
saw it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The bike routed took us around the Sainsbury's one way system and
you were then soon warmed up going up Paddockhall, the foot-down
was very sensible at The Dolphin mini roundabout and a massive
25mph NE wind then rocketed you along the A272 and down the
Cuckfield bypass. There was a lot of debris on the road and a
sapling tree down just south of Ansty, there were very strong cross
winds here and I held on to the tri bars like never before. We then
knew what was coming.... a turn North into Issacs Lane and a
massive head wind to fight. Fortunately there were always lots of
cyclist to chase down here, but as we all crawled along, catching
them was sometimes impossible. At the top of Issacs, you had to
dodge the road works barriers which were now half way over the
road, and for me a Crocodile Dundee hat,&nbsp; which blew off a
marshals head as I passed. A left turn, for another roller coaster
ride on the Cuckfield Bypass, Ansty, Burgess Hill, Issacs lane
circuit, before heading back to the Dolphin. I mad dash down
Paddockhall before a dismount, and another scan for my bag, still
doggedly standing where I had last left it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The run exited the centre left, up the tiny Pasture Hill Road, left
up Harlands Rd and once you had got to the top and would have a
reasonable flat run, you turned left and down the very steep
Lucasters Rd. Up the other side of Lucasters and once you were
almost at the top, a left turn into a footpath, for a steep decent
back down to the centre and around the back. You then played a bit
of dodgems with the bikers coming back, and had 4 loops of this
1.25km roller coaster of a run! I had a bit of an issue with my
number, I had lost the front number pinned to my cycle top, so I
had to rotate my cycle top 180 degrees, to get the number on the
right way around. This of course meant my top was on the wrong way
around, I must have looked rather odd, especially as my neck zip
was undone pretty much all the way down to the bottom of my back.
The nice point about a small loop is you get to see all your team
mates, especially when you run as slow as me. I was undertaken by
Mike Jaffe, looking fresh after his impressive 3.14 in the Brighton
marathon, Fiona Bussell on her way to her historic victory, James
Dear overtook me several times, Ant overtook me and put his arm
around me offering support, either that or he was trying to slow
himself down going down Lucasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The presentation followed soon after the race, I cheered very
loudly to the thank you to the Marshalls, many of whom were MSTC
members and did a fantastic job in the wind and pouring rain, and
an even loader cheer for Fiona's first place, congratulations to
her. I will be back for more next
year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past we have never had more than 6 athletes racing a
Duathlon. This time we had 18 starters, and had it not been for the
clashes with Marshman and Steyning Triathlons it would have been
quite a few more! Mind you - the Marshman turned out to be a
duathlon because the water was too cold!</p>

<p>The weather was the main talking point before the start. Cold
and wet and with increasing wind, but compared to the conditions
the weekend before it was something of an improvement.</p>

<p><br />
 The race briefing does not usually provide any interesting
material for reports, but James was so focused on the forthcoming
race that he could not get his head around the idea of a circuit of
the car park for T1 and had to have it explained in words of one
syllable. However, he had written the risk assessment for
transition himself!</p>

<p><br />
 The first 10k at least got everyone warmed up. &nbsp;Neil and
James set off at a blistering pace. Whilst this would be a quick
course in the dry, the wet conditions were totally different. There
was mud, standing water, some technical turns where it was slippery
underfoot and one dead turn to be negotiated every lap, but it is a
great scenic route and an accurate 10k measured with a wheel. Neil
(37.29) had the edge over James (38.37) and it would have been more
but for a small error on the first lap which cost him 10 seconds.
Rob, Steve and Mike were much closer together with only 24 seconds
separating them at T1 - all about 41minutes. Rachel (46.44) led
Hazel (47.42) in the ladies race. In the short Duathlon Fiona had a
very fast 5k in 20.38, well ahead of Callum and Jade.</p>

<p><br />
 There were no great issues for anyone in T1 in the end but John
MacTear became completely disorientated once he got out on the
road. He first tried to cycle in completely the opposite way to
that which he was supposed to. Fortunately David Ricketts was on
hand to scream at him to go the other way - which he duly did -
straight down the muddy Downslink path! David shouted at him again,
and by process of elimination (he had now gone down every incorrect
route he possibly could) John did a muddy U-turn and finally went
the right way.</p>

<p><br />
 The bike route featured a patented, height co-ordinated marshal
system to make sure everyone turned at the correct roundabout. The
short course featured a short marshal, and the long course a tall
marshal at the respective turn points. It clearly works as no-one
went wrong on the bike circuit, and the only challenge was the
weather. It was very windy and whichever course was being ridden it
was into the headwind for the entire first half. Of course this
made for a much quicker second half. It was also now steadily
raining, just to make sure everyone got extremely cold, especially
hands and feet.</p>

<p><br />
 James overhauled Neil on the bike as expected, with a 61m05s
transitions and bike split time, and gained 3 minutes in total, to
exit T2 2m23s ahead. Rachel overtook Martin, and Hazel overtook
John on the bike leg, and Del had the vision of Trevor overtaking
him like he was part of the Tour de France! Both Trevor and Del
overtook Kate, but she did not have any aero bars which would have
made a huge difference. Callum had the fastest Short course bike
split with 41.48, which was not quite enough to catch Fiona, who
left T2 34seconds ahead. Jade(49.07), Jean(49.42) and Julie (50.51)
all completed the bike leg in the same order as they had left T1.
Rose had a very steady ride and having been round the course 2
weeks earlier was much more confident with her riding and did
57.36.</p>

<p><br />
 T2 caused many more problems, mainly for the long course athletes
because with frozen fingers and blocks of ice for feet it was very
difficult to do anything. Rob was so cold he needed a hand with his
helmet. Pete was happy to oblige! Hazel nearly resorted to doing
the second run with her hat on. It was difficult to get shoes on
with such cold hands, but eventually everyone was out running
again.</p>

<p><br />
 Fiona easily pulled clear of Callum to do her last 2.5k in 10.43,
Callum finished second with a 12.18 split and Jade made up some
time with a 12.03. The long course race was proving quite a
spectacle. It was clear that Neil was not giving up and ran an
incredible 19.08, gaining on James all the way round. James had
paced it well however and had 69seconds spare at the finish. Rob
ran an impressive 20.38 to finish 3rd and was always pulling away
from Steve who lost a minute over the 5k, finishing 4th and
maintaining a 3 minute advantage over Mike. &nbsp;The next fastest
5k was run by Kate in 24.15, making up a lot of time, comfortably
faster than Rachel and Martin and much faster than the others and
clearly enjoying it in spite of the conditions. Alan commented on
her big smile as she was running round (and honourable mentions
went to Julie, Fiona and Mike for being especially cheerful in the
conditions). Apparently Rob looked as frozen as he felt, and Trevor
looked positively pale by the finish.</p>

<p><br />
 The marshals enjoyed the race and several have told me how fired
up they now feel about getting race fit. It was great watching the
tussle between James and Neil - hopefully the first of many. As is
now typical of out own races, all the earlier finishers cheered in
the later ones and both Del and Kate had huge cheers when they
finished. Several people have commented on how good the camaraderie
is within the club - and the fact that everyone feels like this
after a race in difficult conditions is great testament to what is
now being achieved. For many of the athletes this was their first
Duathlon. Well Done to all of you.</p>

<p>I am running in memory of my Grandad, Jock who died in June 2011
after suffering from heart conditions for several years. &nbsp;He
was very active and a keen runner, running many half marathons, and
only stopped on doctors orders in his seventies due to his heart
condition. &nbsp;His favourite past time was walking his dogs
around the local country parks. &nbsp;I know he is very proud of
all my achievements to date, and I wanted to dedicate this
challenge to him. &nbsp;This challenge would only have been made
better if he was here to see me do it.</p>

<p><br />
So the challenge itself... The event starts on the 19th May at 1pm
and I will be running as many laps of a 6.55 mile loop as possible
in 24 hours. &nbsp;I am hoping to run at least a minimum of 50
miles, and hope to be capable of more on the day... but you have my
promise that no matter what I will do my very best! &nbsp;There
will be an area at the race HQ where I can rest/eat as and when I
feel necessary, but the rest of my time will be spent running.</p>

<p><br />
The British Heart Foundation save thousands of lives every year
thanks to their ground-breaking research and innovative health
initiatives. &nbsp;They rely on the generosity of people like you
to help them to continue their vital work.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Due to the water below being 11C and an air
temp hovering around 6/7C the triathlon has been changed to a
duathlon on safety grounds - BTF rules say that below 11C, then the
swim should not go ahead and so it ended up being a 5.3km run a 56
mile bike and the full half marathon.<br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span> 

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>Instead of combining the reports into one I
have left them separate as the opinions on the race
vary.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"
class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Training
aside, it seemed like I had done no&nbsp;preparation for the race
itself as it was only on the Saturday afternoon that I worked out
what time I'd have to leave on the Sunday that I decided it would
be best to stay over somewhere. After a lot of panicked calls I
managed to get a place quite close, it appears that there had been
some cancellations due to the water temperature reports. The
organiser had informed that the water temperature had reached a
balmy 15 degrees, one of the lads at the place I stayed at said
that there was a thermometer at the venue when they registered
earlier on the Saturday and it indicated a very frosty
10&nbsp;degrees. Brrr!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Needless to
say the swim was cancelled on the day, but in typical disorganised
fashion it was only at the last minute.&nbsp;This was changed to a
5.3Km run, much to Steve's disgust! This threw all my clothing
preparations and in my panic I forgot my timing chip. A couple of
minutes before my wave started I made a mad dash for the car to get
it. I returned clutching the device only to find the rest of my
wave disappearing into the distance. I quickly caught up with the
tail enders only to find Kay running her own race. I managed to
work through about half of the wave before a very pedestrian
T1.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>Unfortunately I got stuck behind a car that was trying to
overtake some of the other cyclists at the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;of
the bike leg.. It took about half a mile of shouting to get around
the car before I could start to get motoring. The bike course
wasn't quite as bad as I was expecting, fairly flat with a couple
of hills. It was wet and a bit blowy so I was glad I had my thermal
cycle gear on. I started to get a bit saddle sore after nearly 50
miles and struggled to maintain an aero position after that. It was
at this point of the bike course that we started to head back to
Camber Sands and Lydd, directly into a strong headwind
:-(</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Getting off
the bike at T2 felt strange as I had no feeling in my feet! I
hobbled over to my transition area and changed quickly (too quickly
as it turned out) before heading back out on the run. It was at
this point that I realised that wearing a soggy thermal bike top on
the run was not such a good idea, as was wearing an extra pair of
cycle shorts with a super thick pad. Despite this I managed to set
off at a fairly quick pace of about 7:40 mins per mile which I
managed to keep going for over half the distance of the run course
before starting to tire. By mile 9 I was starting to slow down a
lot and walk through the aid stations, by mile 10 this started to
manifest into the odd 'walk of shame'. What I did like about the
run was that the organisers had printed our names on the race
number which the few hardy souls that were out supporting used to
cheer us on.. That felt good.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Gutted that
the swim was cancelled due to water being too cold. Have to respect
the officials that enforce these rules for our well-being, however,
30-mins in 11 degree lake wearing a wet-suit would have been ok by
me.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Had been
looking forward to a decent dress rehearsal with Roth just a couple
of months away. However, this race was therefore turned into a
duathlon.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Well
organised event and the marshals were extremely friendly, despite
the horrid weather they had to put up with.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"

performances and are looking good for 10 hour finish times at Roth,

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Steve and
Jim suffered set-backs with muscle strain and puncture
respectively. Nice fast cycle course that is predominantly flat and
reasonably free of traffic.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Would do
the event another year despite it being a little disappointing this
time around. Good value, good half-ironman on a good course with
good organisation.</span></p>

swimming or not, the first run was all about getting warm, control
and taking it easy so had a fairly lesurly jog round once in T1 I
had to change into cycle kit decisions to be made and I went with
the wrap up warm one instead of the get out quick. As you can tell
I</span> <span class="postbody1"><span>decided to ignore my times
in transition (11 mins in total) and make sure I was properly
clothed and could walk.</span></span></p>

you like the cold, wind, wet and lots of drafters this all paled
into insignificance when my hamstrings started to play up. The bike
took us through Camber sands I had never been there before and was
looking forward to seeing it, I think I smelt it first which
confused me as the smell was old oil in deep fat fryers, not nice
when you are putting that much effort in, I went past the source.
Pontins, well made me go a little faster to get out of there, very
dull uneventful bike so into T2.</span></p>

quite a few guys landed quite hard. This is where my troubles
really began as when I got of my bike I could not move my legs and
had to lean on the bike to move around transition quite strange,
racked the bike and got out of my warm bike gear and into my
trainers. Tried to move and could only manage a poor hobble,
hamstrings, hips everything was screaming to DNF, bollox I said so
I zipped up the man suit and moved slowly out to the run. Said
hello to Kay, Emma Goodhead and kids and moved slowly off into my
own personal hell.</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Ant triumphs by 1 second as weird glowing orange beach ball appears in sky]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Perhaps inspired by the unexpected
appearance of a weird, glowing orange object resembling a beach
ball in the sky, Ant Grey led home a strong contingent of 18 MSTC
athletes at the East Grinstead Triathlon, narrowly pipping Phil
Couch to the line by just one second.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">It was an outstanding win for Ant, making
up for being forced by poor weather into competing in a hastily
rearranged duathlon at the Marshman the previous weekend.&nbsp; Ant
finished 15<sup>th</sup> overall at East Grinstead in 1.17.04, with
Phil in 16<sup>th</sup> place in 1.17.05.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Special mention should also go to Rob Cox,
finishing his first-ever triathlon, after a winter of dedicated
training, in 127<sup>th</sup> position overall (out of 381
finishers) and with a very decent time of 1.30.34.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Perhaps the day's other outstanding
performance came at the far end of the MSTC field, with Angela
Murray crediting her lovely new blue Scott road bike for shaving
six minutes off her time at last year's East Grinstead tri, her
first ever sprint race.&nbsp; Actually, her improved performance
was also anchored by a very strong run time of 25.33.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">In third place among the MSTC athletes (and
26<sup>th</sup> overall) was mystery man Dave Lashbrook, who does
no training that any other member knows of, and then turns up and
puts in a storming time of 1.19.00 to take 26<sup>th</sup> position
overall.&nbsp; Dave was given no split times, having somehow
contrived to miss the lengthy queue at poolside for the
distribution of timing chips, but was seen scattering hapless
beginners from his lane in the pool because he wanted an early
start in order to "get home for the birth of Lynn's sister's
baby."</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Then came a gang of three separated by only
a few places: Steve Crocker, Pete Harris and Mike Jaffe, in
34<sup>th</sup>, 36<sup>th</sup> and 43<sup>rd</sup> positions
overall, providing the backbone of the MSTC effort on the day, with
Pete putting in a particularly strong performance, considering his
recent injury problems.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Behind them were Martin Shoesmith in
61<sup>st</sup> position and Paul Wills in 70<sup>th</sup>, with
Paul showing a massive improvement in all disciplines since last
year.&nbsp; Ah, the benefits of winter training in Australia!</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Fiona Bussell was first MSTC woman home in
1.28.11, her usual strong run and an improved bike split just
squeezing her into the top 100 in 99<sup>th</sup> place, followed
by Callum Murray in his now customary position three minutes behind
Fiona.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Just two minutes behind came David
Ricketts, with Callum now firmly in his sights, followed by Peter
Court in 1.36.33.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Nancy Gilbert put in her usual live-wire
performance to finish second MSTC woman in 1.37.35, including a
best-ever sprint triathlon run split of 23.45.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Then came Jean Fish, blonde hair flying and
loving every minute of the race, despite her recent marathon
exertions, in 1.44.43, followed by Claire Creswell, who said she
hates sprint triathlons because they're far too short, but still
scored a highly respectable 1.47.38.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Mandie Cawthra, competing in her first
triathlon for many years, was delighted to finish in under two
hours by a nicely-judged 10 seconds!</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">The race had expanded this year, but
remains the well-organised but friendly club-run model to which we
must aspire with our own triathlon.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Innovations this year included numbers that
also bore the name of the participant, meaning that marshals and
others could call their support for the athletes by name.&nbsp;
Steve Alden, who had loyally turned up to support the MSTC athletes
along with Rose Ryan, was heard to mutter: "Suppose this means
we've got to have names on the numbers at our race now."&nbsp;
Certainly one to ponder.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">The support of Steve, Rose and the athletes
who had already finished was, as usual, much appreciated - although
I, personally, was in no state to give a detailed and considered
answer when the always enthusiastic Steve tried to strike up a
conversation as I left transition and set off on the first of the
two agonising run laps.</p>

<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Receiving no reply to his conversational
gambit, "How's it going, Callum?," beyond a grimace, Steve was left
to provide his own answer: "Hard!"</p>

was very nearly only 9 starters when Rachel realized she had a
faulty inner tube just 20 minutes before her start time. Rob and
Steve tried to help but when it became apparent that they might
have to get their hands dirty they very chivalrously headed off to
the start. Rachel was left to flutter her eyelids and look helpless
at the HQ - a much more effective strategy as it was sorted in the
nick of time. She made her start with minutes to spare and it had
clearly got her adrenaline up as she then did an excellent
68m36s.</span></span></p>

Ricketts, Steve Crocker and Martin Shoesmith. Martin has in fact
done a lot of time trialling in the dim and distant past and was
actually quite good, but the tough windy conditions were still a
challenge. He finished in an superb 67.34, nicely getting even with
Steve Crocker, by finishing 3 minutes faster - the same margin that
Steve had won by the previous week at East Grinstead. Great effort
for a first time though. David Ricketts took some convincing that
as it was a race, he should really use his very nice race bike.
79.36 was deserved reward - though without tri-bars - hopefully the
first of many TTs.</span></span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[This was my first attempt at ultra running............]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>This
was my first attempt at ultra running, and whilst a 24 hour running
challenge was maybe a little over ambitious, I liked the set up of
the challenge- it was a little over a 6.5 mile loop, which you
completed as many times as possible.<span>&nbsp;</span> As I had no
idea how far I could actually run I thought this concept was a good
idea, as I could stop whenever I needed (no pressure of going point
to point) and also could pick up food/drink as I passed through the
checkpoint each time.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So I guess
I best give you some background before I talk about the race
itself.<span>&nbsp;</span> I hadn't trained any longer than 26.2
miles, and had only done 2 marathons this year.<span>&nbsp;</span>
I was meant to do another 2 marathons in 2 days in early May but
got an IT band injury in my hip whilst running the Brighton
Marathon, so had hardly done any running since (mostly just
biking).<span>&nbsp;</span> I had also been asked by several
friends and family members to get an ECG test to check my heart was
ok and I wasn't in danger of dropping dead at any second, so I got
one with my nurse. <span>&nbsp;</span> The test results were not
given to me until the Thursday, 2 days before my race, when the
doctor (who had the worst bedside manner I've ever come across)
rang me at work and told me that the results were inconclusive and
she thought I had a 'Long QT'... when I asked what this was she
told me to Google it (really!!) which nearly gave me a heart attack
in itself when I looked... oh yeah, it's that condition that causes
people to drop dead at any second...great (ironic really as you're
not meant to shock people who have that
condition!).<span>&nbsp;</span> She would not give me any further
details of my results (she had referred them to a cardiologist but
results could take weeks) we finished the phone call with her
saying 'I wouldn't run for 24 hours without some conclusive
results' and then the final caring words of 'I don't see why people
can't just do things in moderation'... Charming!<span>&nbsp;</span>
To cut a long story short I ended up getting an appointment the
same night with a cardiologist at the Nuffield in Brighton (hello
overdraft), a second ECG, and being told that I was ok to run...
phew!!<span>&nbsp;</span> My long QT is at the top end of the
'normal' range so all is good.<span>&nbsp;</span> I must admit it
was a massive wake up call in the few hours that I had to wait to
go to the Nuffield that I realised how quickly everything could be
taken away from you... I literally don't know what I would have
done if I'd been told I couldn't do any of my crazy sporting antics
anymore.<span>&nbsp;</span> I hope I never take what I'm able to do
forgranted again.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Race day-
the race started at 1pm on the Saturday, and 34 of us set
off.<span>&nbsp;</span> The course was beautiful, a mixture of
mainly farm tracks between fields (if you had hay fever or allergic
to rapeseed you would have been screwed!) and a couple of
roads.<span>&nbsp;</span> Whilst some of the ground was uneven it
was a very flat course so you could get into a nice
rhythm.<span>&nbsp;</span> My tactic was to keep a steady 11
min/mile pace, and walk through the checkpoint to eat and
drink.<span>&nbsp;</span> This went well and I had a couple of
runners to speak to that were running the same
pace.<span>&nbsp;</span> I ran the first marathon in 4.58... way
too fast Jade!<span>&nbsp;</span> Although I had kept my pace I
hadn't been walking for long enough through the check
point.<span>&nbsp;</span> I decided at this point that I should
just keep running at this pace until I could run no
more.<span>&nbsp;</span> I should mention at this point that my hip
started hurting at only 6 miles in, I was worried this was going to
cause an issue but with some ibuprofen and the seemingly magical
Cliff Shot Bloxs that I always use in races (no, unfortunately I'm
not being sponsored by them!) the pain disappeared, and after the
first marathon I had no aches and pains at all... this was not to
last, I knew that, so I just enjoyed every moment of running and
was in quiet wonderment and awe that my little legs kept
going.<span>&nbsp;</span> I think I got to around 40 miles when it
got too dark and I had to run with my headtorch.<span>&nbsp;</span>
I'll be honest I'm a complete wimp in the dark, and was pretty
scared about this prospect (it really was very dark in the
countryside) but apart from the bullfrogs it was really peaceful
and calming running in the dark.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Every so
often I could see a headtorch bobbing along in the distance, and I
knew I wasn't alone.<span>&nbsp;</span> I carried on running until
46 miles and then my legs starting to complain, as always my quads
were starting to scream at me.<span>&nbsp;</span> Dinner was served
at HQ, so I ate some veggie soup, potatoes and pasta and set off
again on a run/walk strategy to cover 53 miles.<span>&nbsp;</span>
All in all just under 12 hours, I was very pleased with
myself.<span>&nbsp;</span> The only problem was as soon as I
stopped my legs seized up.<span>&nbsp;</span> I knew I had to rest,
so I somehow got myself in to the boot of my car (back seats
already folded down) and slept fitfully (damn cramp) for about 3
hrs.<span>&nbsp;</span> I woke up and was surprised that my legs
felt a bit better, as I opened the car boot I was humbled to see
one of the guys (who ended up being the winner) running past to
start another loop.<span>&nbsp;</span> I also felt massively guilty
for sleeping and scorned myself for not just pushing through the
night.<span>&nbsp;</span> I had a quick breakfast and set off again
with a crazy ironman shuffle going on, it was a pointless and
energy zapping exercise, and realised walking was just as
fast.<span>&nbsp;</span> My knee started to become very painful
with a shooting pain and cracking/clicks every time I put my foot
down, I had to look at the bigger picture and the rest of the race
season so I called it a day with just another 7 miles under my belt
that morning.<span>&nbsp;</span> Total distance covered- 60
miles.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Do I feel
like I could go further in the future- most
definitely.<span>&nbsp;</span> But for a first attempt I am very
pleased that I did my best.<span>&nbsp;</span> I'm fully aware that
had I just walked for 24 hrs then I would have covered a bigger
distance, but that was not what my challenge was about, and I
certainly wouldn't have felt happy doing that. <span>&nbsp;</span>
I wanted to run as far as I could, and running until you drop is
more my motto. <span>&nbsp;</span> I was more pleased with getting
a double marathon under my belt than walking until the cows come
home.<span>&nbsp;</span> But I have learnt that I am clearly no
good at pacing myself!<span>&nbsp;</span> Would I do an ultra
again, absolutely!<span>&nbsp;</span> Phil Couch (I'm sure it was
you Phil) told me a quote last year before my ironman from T.S.
Elliot that says 'Only those who will risk going too far, can
possibly find out how far one can go' and that has certainly stuck
with me.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I shall
stop my waffling now (gold stars to anyone who has made it this
far, you're nearly at the end!) but I just want to say a massive
thank you to everyone for your brilliant support, encouragement and
kind words before, during and after the race, and of course the
donations to the BHF who I ran to raise money for.</span></p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Brighton Triathlon Race Series - Race 1 , 30th May - Madeira Drive , Brighton

This is a FREE local event organised by local people! ]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>This is a
<em></em> FREE <em>local</em> event organised by <em>local</em>
people! I've no idea who they are except they're called Kimi and
Kurt! Kurt wears an Ironman tshirt. Its all 'organised' over
Facebook but the details are rather vague except for kick off at
7pm on Madeira Drive, meet up abut 6pm. Just before 6pm I was on
facebook at home telling some people who had come down from London
where the start probably was... it all felt rather like an illegal
rave!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>According
to my friend who did it last year 10 people took part but this time
there were between 50 and 60.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Transition
is some poles taped up to some metal barriers beside Madeira Drive.
Its all a bit chaotic but everyone is very enthusiastic. And its
FREE! I get there early and set up and then spot Steve Mac who is
waiting for Kay.. they are both competing but Kay has all the gear
in the car and must be stuck in traffic. I go for a quick jog to
warm up. When I get back Kay is there with 5 mins to go before the
start.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Race
briefing and Kurt explains the routes. Swim is diagonally out to a
buoy and then straight out to a 2nd one and then parallel to the
beach and straight back in. There is no buoy to mark where parallel
runs out and straight back starts :s &nbsp;So a guy ( rumoured to
be an ex world champion at Standard distance ) suggests we just go
straight back diagonal from the 2nd buoy as everyone will cut the
corner anyway. So that's decided and thats what we're doing!...
when your used to race briefings being a list of rules you must
follow its a rather refreshing change allowing the competitors to
change the course :)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>So over the
pebbles to the sea.. &nbsp;I've taken my run shoes to leave by the
start flags ( haha take that you dastardly pebbles ). In for a
quick acclimatisation and its a lot colder than Ardingly! I'm
really glad I have 2 caps on. Lots of bubble blowing with my head
under water, until it freezes and then its out and 20 secs later
we're off!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>There's
actually not too much bumping, probably because its just about
impossible to see the buoys when you are at sea level and there are
a few heads and arms in front obscuring the view, so everyone goes
off in what they think is the general direction and head out in a
fan. I generally follow the pack hoping they are better at sighting
than me. Its been quite choppy on the way out and I've had a few
mouthfuls of delightfully salty water! The waves and current should
be with us on the way back. Its does seem much faster going back
but I end up reaching the beach early and have to swim along the
shore to the flags. So even though the swim was shortened from the
original 800m I reckon I easily swam that anyway.&nbsp;Run shoes on
and I walk up the beach pulling the westsuit top down and then jog
the last bit.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span>Meanwhile...Steve and Kay start after everyone else and head
in the general direction of the pier, get bored or lost and head
back!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>And onto
the bike - not your usual left turn at every junction with this
route. Highlights include :</span></p>

<ul>
<li>a right turn across the busy seafront road, with optional
cycling down the pavement until you find a break in the
traffic</li>

<li>trying to get across to the right lane of a very fast road to
go right round the Ovingdean roundabout</li>

<li>a fast decent with 180 degree turn at the bottom</li>

<li>a turnaround point where you had to go round the 'No' of 'No
Through Road' that was painted on the road</li>

<li>the other turn point is a planter in the centre of Madeira
Drive , basically a U turn in the middle of the road</li>

<li>Heavy mist descending and thinking I should have brought a
light as all the cars turn on theirs.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Luckily
I've cycled in Brighton for many years so aren't too phased by most
of this. Unfortunately Kay hasn't and despite Steve's valiant
attempt to get Kay to draft him round the course she decides its
too dangerous. Personally I think being that close to Steves arse
would make anyone stop. So now its full speed ahead for Steve as he
attempts to track me down from a long way back!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I actually
manage to overtake a few people on the bike and not too many pass
me. I take one guy near the end of the 2nd lap and he then drafts
me in so I'm determined to beat him on the run , which is helped by
him telling me he is crap at running!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Onto the
run , a flat 5km on Madeira Drive , 2 laps ... again round the 'No'
and the planter. I get into a rhythm and get away from Mr Crap
Runner, unfortunately it turns out I'm not that much better at
running than him and he catches me up , so we have a chat and run
together. Rounding the 'No' another guy passes us and I'm feeling
ok so I go with him.. I manage to stay about 20 yards back but its
enough to break Mr Crap. Steve's finally off the bike and passes me
going the other way making various gestures suggesting he's got me
in his sights!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>On the
second lap I try to catch the faster guy but he's drawing away...
&nbsp;I do catch the Tango man who seems to have entered the
triathlon.. or maybe he's Dutch. And across the finish and a medal!
And there's a goody bag left on my bike! and a bottle of water ...
fizzy :( .. but a hot pasty as well !! And its all FREE!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I set off
on a cool down run and pass Steve coming in so I turn around and we
sprint to the end and he nearly gets a PB for the 5km :)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I really
enjoyed the whole thing, ok it was a little 'different' to other
triathlons but we're talking about a free event which a few people
have given up their time to organise and it was great fun ... and
there was a hot pasty at the end!!</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><br />
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>I think
Steve liked it too despite the late start , not too sure Kay would
do it again though. So its not for everyone I would say
:)</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It appears
my new approach to Tri's this season is to participate only in
certain parts of any event. After the Mini-Marshman confusion which
resulted in me delivering a strong 5k but no bike (and no swim
following its cancellation), this time I managed the swim and half
the bike, but dnf'd due to conditions on the bike course, so did
not complete the run.&nbsp; Hopefully my next race will see me
complete all three disciplines.<br />
<br />
 The Brighton Tri series is great for those who are comfortable
cycling in challenging routes which take in right hand turns, dual
lanes, roadworks (at the moment) and heavy traffic. My cycling is
deliberately limited to quiet lanes of rural Sussex and therefore
these conditions, coupled with the seafog that swept in during lap
one of the bike leg, proved a step too far for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
swim however was wonderful.&nbsp; With a 7pm start, we swam into a
flat calm sea made quite beautiful by the setting sun. To catch
sight of Steve in front of me, with his fine swim stroke
sillhoetted against the horizon reminded me how rewarding sea
swimming can be. The strong current on the way back also reminded
my of the power of the sea and I was very glad to have Steve near
me as there was no other support out there.&nbsp; After what seemed
to be a very very long time, we made it to shore and despite a 2
minute delay in starting, we still managed to overtake a couple of
people on the way.<br />
<br />
 Would I do it again?&nbsp; Probably not until the roadworks are
gone. However, I would recommend it to anyone who has no issues
with traffic. In summary, the event itself is great as a way to
manage your race fitness without incurring cost and is informal and
friendly, whilst still allowing you to race hard if you want
to.&nbsp; And a free event including a sea swim is a great way to
introduce yourself to another style of tri.</span></p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
results were outstanding with our 5 Great Britain Age Groupers
finishing in the first 8 for the men including Neil Giles winning
overall, James Dear 3<sup>rd</sup>, Rob Hoodless 6<sup>th</sup>,
Steve Alden 7<sup>th</sup> (first over 50), and Loz Wintergold
8<sup>th.</sup></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>Rachel Baker - another GB Age Grouper won the women's
race overall, with both Hazel Tuppen (3<sup>rd</sup> lady) and
Fiona Bussell (6<sup>th</sup> lady) winning their respective age
groups.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>We
have all been getting used to competing in poor weather and this
day was true to form. There was a massive storm the night before
with nearly an inch of rain, so the bike course was covered in
debris (and a strategically placed fire engine!), whilst the run
route was soggy, muddy and slippery. Luckily the swim was meant to
be wet.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
day started with registration. Most people commented that it was a
joy having Kay and Pippa in charge as it became a stress free zone.
Sam and Alex were also on hand in various places including
cheerfully encouraging everyone. Dave Lashbrook left it
particularly late and was the very last athlete to register,
although he was in plenty of time.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
swim had many of us racing in the same lanes simultaneously and
most people gave way to the faster swimmers (sorry
Dave).<span>&nbsp;</span> Phil was sure he had done 2 extra lengths
but as it was he was the club's second fastest swimmer (only Neil
'the fish' Giles was faster). It is clear from the times that all
the swim training and coaching is paying off. Martin Shoesmith's
impressive 9.06 is a good example after only a couple of seasons.
Ant Grey and Loz counted lengths before they raced, but no-one paid
them enough get away with fewer lengths. As the ground outside the
pool was so rough it was permitted to leave clothing and shoes
outside. Steve Crocker took it a stage further by rapidly donning a
pair of slippers before racing up the hill. However in a post-race
interview he admitted they were handmade Italian leather shoes with
special soles for grip, which enabled a super quick run into
transition.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
bike course is well known to be challenging for a sprint course.
The damp conditions reduced visibility with glasses steaming up,
whilst also making the ground slippery. There was gravel everywhere
just to add to the challenge. Charlie Langhorne recorded a
remarkable 37.09 bike split some 3 minutes ahead of James Dear in
an equally amazing 40.15 (including both transitions) and Neil was
only 17 seconds behind. Colin Chambers slowed down to admire the
fire engine on the fastest section of the course and still managed
to be a few seconds faster than Steve A, who in turn was delighted
to be a few seconds faster than Rob. Phil Couch was racing up
behind Steve Mac, and was preparing a suitable witty remark as he
passed, when his chain came off, and it took him till well into the
run to catch up again. By this time his 'wit ability' had long
since left him and he could only manage a grimace. Following his
problems with an errant horse at East Grinstead he has not been
enjoying the bike legs lately. By contrast Ant Grey's new bike has
been a great investment - nothing significant has fallen off - yet!
In Balcombe many of our athletes were cheered on by Mat Record as
he happened to be out walking as we all passed through. This did
not help Julie, when she punctured in the village and had to start
the long walk home before eventually being picked up by the broom
wagon.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>Transition is always interesting. Although Jim was
doing the 'other' race, he caused great amusement by spending
seemingly several minutes putting on extra articles of clothing and
reportedly putting gel in his hair! Dave Lashbrook completely
forgot to put any trainers on at all and was called back by the
referee to dress properly. Lucy Williams managed to get out of T2
having lost both her numbers and Loz struggled through transitions
largely due to being affected by the wet and cold which clearly
slowed him down.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
run was a real challenge compared to a dry day. There was a long
slog up the soggy hill, followed by tricky corners on thick mud. 4
times! Grip was a real issue and the course was also about 200m
longer than previous years. Getting elastic bands became tricky as
sometimes there wasn't one available at just the right moment. The
'bandsmen' sorted it all out though and everyone did the correct
number of laps, although David Ricketts made hard work of it by
dropping the bands every time! Claire Cresswell even managed to
give the marshals a version of the 'Cresswell
Wiggle'</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The
nicest thing about the run was being cheered on by Pippa, Kay and
Jim on most of the laps - that and finishing!</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>A
special mention must go to Helen Graham doing her first triathlon.
She was cold, wet and miserable and cheerfully shouted 'never
again' as she completed each run lap. But she carried on and
finished well, and I am sure she will be racing again
soon.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span><span>One
final note! We found out after our triathlon today that Steve
Crocker and Fiona Bussell each won the Weald Sprint Triathlon

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>BAR Race 4 - Arun 3.8km swim - Saturday
23</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup> <span>June
2012</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>A</span></span></span><span><span><span>lthough
it was overcast and with a howling wind 14 hardy MSTC athletes took
to the murky waters of the River Arun. Steve Mac jetted in
specially following a week of 'one on one' alpine action with his
coach. With the altitude training he was hoping for another big
performance. Pete Harris tried the opposite approach by avoiding
swimming as much as he could before attempting the
race.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Before the start there is a lot of time to kill
and there were surprisingly few pre-race excuses. Mark Jordan was
trying a new excuse every hour (I've been quite unwell, I'm still
on antibiotics, I feel very tired etc). From my experience this
number of excuses usually means someone is properly fired up for
the race, and so it proved! Trevor, on the hand, barely mentioned
last weeks nasty fall coming down the beacon and Jamie grunted
something about having trained already that
day.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>I knew Mark wasn't really feeling that bad
because we cycled over from Haywards Heath, (2½ hours of constantly
cycling into a head wind) and I couldn't keep up with him. Callum
and Brad kept us company - or I should say kept Mark company as
they were always having to wait for me! Loz also cycled over by an
even longer route (and then ran to the start of the
swim!)</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>This year there were separate starts for the men
and women and altogether there were about 300 swimmers. It is quite
something to be in a fairly narrow waterway at the off with so many
swimmers, because it is crowded and there is a lot of fighting for
space. Most of us tend to look for quieter water and try to get
into a rhythm but some of the stronger ones are right in the thick
of it. The water was definitely faster than last year even with the
headwind. It was astonishing though, to see the fast ladies carve
their way through the field having started 5 minutes behind. I now
realize what they have that I don't - a propeller! It is the only
explanation for the amount of white foaming water they left in
their wake - very impressive.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>At the start Steve Mac sped off but Mark took a
more measured approach and caught him with 1km to go. In the melee
I could not say who was who around me, but Mark was looking for
Steve's stroke so he knew exactly where he was. In the end he
finished 21 seconds ahead in an incredible
56.18.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>After Steve Mac, Jamie Goodhead was the next
finisher, 2 minutes down in 58.22 and interestingly he won his
category. He is recorded in the results as a YOB. I am not sure
what he did to upset the organisers in this way, but at least he
appeared to be the only one. Next year he is hoping to compete in
the ASBO category!</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Loz Wintergold started at the back of the field
and gently cruised through, finishing
4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup> <span>MSTC in 61.38, just 18
seconds ahead of me. I didn't notice him slip by but I am not sure
I could have tried any harder if I had. Andy Jenkins had another
very solid swim in 62.49. I don't know if Jon Webster and Jim
Graham knew just how close they were with just 9 seconds separating
them (64.03 and 64.12). Trevor managed to shrug off his road rash
with 67.34 whilst Pete proved what a strong athlete he is to finish
in 77.07 on very little swimming.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>The ladies all did very well. I hope Claire
Tomsett is delighted with her performance. She had never swum this
distance before and was quite apprehensive before the start. 65.35
was an excellent performance. Julienne has got faster each year she
has done this swim, and 68.29 continued the trend with Claire
Cresswell just 32 seconds behind.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>My performance of the day however goes to Rose
Ryan. She has been working hard on her swim, but finding our time
limited open water swims have not allowed her to swim as far in
training as she would have liked. Nevertheless she had a superb
swim to finish in 70.23.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Afterwards Loz demonstrated his new superquick T1
transition ideas (hopefully the picture is on the website) before
cycling home again with Mark (still not slowing down) Jordan and
myself (almost keeping up).</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span><span><span>Overall it was another great day for MSTC. It is
fantastic going to these events and having your friends around you,
and a healthy bit of competition thrown
in.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>This year's Dambuster promised to be an exciting gladiatorial
fight where worthy opponents slugged it out for a place at the
World champs in NZ. For a club triathlete such as myself it was a
bit like playing with the English National Orchestra on open
strings but in which other sport can the humble part-timer rub
shoulders with some seriously fit athletes J? &nbsp;Although going
solo for the girls we had two seasoned MSTC guys Phil Couch and Jon
Webster and the newly joined but equally experienced and high
performing Neil Giles.</p>

<p>Registration on the previous evening proved to be a test of
character in itself. High winds and low temperatures rendered
Rutland water a danger zone and we were warned that the swim may be
cancelled and the event become a duathlon. Dambuster shambuster!
Welcome to the world of hardcore.we were here to race and race we
would. If we couldn't swim we would run and if we couldn't run we
would crawl (possibly straight back home in my case).</p>

<p>I understand the theory of duathlon but had only completed one
in my entire life (6 weeks ago), at a fraction of the distance. I
was woefully underprepared &nbsp;and called home for some sage
words of encouragement.&nbsp; In a strange&nbsp; way that
answerphone message&nbsp; came straight from the universe.you're on
your own lady it said to me. So as I clutched my T-shirt I knew
that I would have to face my greatest fear. yes, being ridiculed by
my fellow club members if I wimped out, it looked like I would have
to race.</p>

<p>That night I slept fitfully reciting the undertrained
triathlete's prayer.'Please let them cancel the whole dam
thing.'</p>

<p>I rose early and wended my way back to Rutland Water which even
on a dark foreboding Saturday morning is still incredibly
beautiful. Some good news awaited, the swim was on but had to be
shortened by 500m. No such luck with the bike and run.</p>

<p>To avoid hypothermia we were allowed a quick warm up in the
water but then had to come ashore ready for a walk/run start. This
was a first for me and any tips would be most welcome although
somewhat completely useless now. In my mind's eye I entered the
water in a kind of balletic synchronised swimmer's dive, all pointy
toes and aesthetic lines. In reality I minced in, trod on a really
sharp stone and crashed into the water face first like a heffalump.
My race had begun.</p>

<p>The guys, as is the convention had a head start to avoid the
humiliation of being chicked but our boys did us proud with
astonishing swim times of 13:23 (Neil) &nbsp;14:53 (Phil) &amp;
17:30 (Jon).....I like to think I held my end up (or was it my
wetsuit doing that for me) with a respectable 20:10 minutes.</p>

<p>The boys were in and out of T1 in the blink of an eye.actually
in Jon's case it was more of a catnap (2:35 haha) &nbsp;but since I
was trussed up like a Christmas turkey (thank you Phil) and
freezing cold I managed the shocking time of 3:13.(yes Steve Alden
I know it was 2 minutes 30 secs&nbsp; too long!)</p>

<p>Out on the bike the wind was gusty and the course hilly. After a
cracking swim, disaster struck when Neil had a flat. sadly, game
over. Phil and Jon returned with impressive times of 1:14:01 and
1:16:32 respectively, but I'm afraid self-preservation kicked in
and I only managed a disappointing 1:42:16.</p>

<p>A less embarrassing T2 time and then out on the run. Through
woodland and then skirting the reservoir with sheep grazing the
scene belied the hotly contested &nbsp;qualifying places. Jon
christened his brand new trainers in a freshly laid cowpat ensuring
they would definitely be spending the night outside of his tent.
The lads stormed home with run times of 38:03 (Phil) and 40:05
(Jon). With Phil finishing in an overall time of 2:09:10 and
overall position of 125 and Jon 2:18:14 - congratulations for two
&nbsp;outstanding &nbsp;performances and commiserations to Neil
after such an amazing start.</p>

<p>The field was thinning but I felt no shame in bringing up the
rear. I managed to claw back a few places and after a 55 minute run
bumbled over the finish line in 3:02:51 to the welcome sight and
cheers of Jon Webster. We may have been thin on the ground but we
made a lot of noise. One advantage of getting older is that I came
12<sup>th</sup> in my age group and no I am not saying how many
took part but I wasn't last!</p>

<p>First male finished in 1:47:29 and first female in 2:04:59!
Wow!</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I woke up at 4am and although I had the usual pre race nerves, I
was actually quite calm and looking forward to race (very different
to last year when I was terrified).&nbsp; This year felt very
different in many ways as I was doing the same race purely with the
intention of beating last years time (14.02) and with the huge
pirate presence I knew it would be a fantastic day.&nbsp; But in
some ways I felt I had more pressure this year to succeed.&nbsp;
Last years goal was to survive, no pressure of times but just to
finish... this year I didn't want to just finish, I wanted to race,
and I wanted a sub 14.&nbsp; I knew I was stronger and fitter than
last year, I had put in a lot of training for this, and now it
boiled down to this one day to prove what I was capable of, the day
to lay it all down.&nbsp; I felt I had a lot to prove to
myself.&nbsp; I was worried about things out of my control, mainly
a mechanical/puncture on the bike, getting a cold/bug before the
race or getting an upset stomach from the water, but I knew
ultimately that worrying about these things were a pointless waste
of energy, what will be will be.&nbsp; All I could concentrate on
was the hard training I had put in during the year- marathons,
including a massive p.b, a 60 mile ultra run, and the tough 114
mile 9000ft ascent King of the Downs bike ride that was 9 hours in
the saddle.&nbsp; I had put the hard work in and I really wanted
that reward, bring on the sub 14, I was ready to race!&nbsp;</p>

<p>So 4am I forced some food down (this never gets easier), got
ready and made my way down to the start.&nbsp; Another beautiful
morning with clear blue skies was waiting for the 1000 people
toeing the start line to try and become Outlaws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swim&nbsp; 1.19.39&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now to say I hadn't trained enough for the swim was an
understatement, looking back on training I had done an average of
just&nbsp; 40 lengths per week this year, and 2 open water
swims.&nbsp; This was the one area where I just hadn't got the
training in.&nbsp; I am confident in the water and knew I could
just 'get round' but had no idea in what time.&nbsp; I hadn't even
done the distance in training, let alone timed myself.&nbsp; I
started at the back of pen 1, in the hope that the fast swimmers
would go ahead and I would be left in clear water, I much prefer
clear water to following feet and getting kicked.&nbsp; Anyway,
that didn't happen, pens 2-4 all grouped together and proceeded to
swim over me...literally!&nbsp; Now I've had the usual kicks,
punches, people not sighting and swimming into you etc, and I'm
happy to hold my own in those situations...but people literally
mounting me from behind...that's a new one on me!!&nbsp; This was
people literally swimming over me from behind, arms either side of
my body basically trying to drown me... a swift sharp kick to
whichever bodily part I made contact with seemed to have the
desired effect of them moving away!&nbsp; The turnaround point came
fast and with it the sight of Mum and Jess the pirate dog on the
banks waiting for me, a joy to see them amongst the madness of the
swim.&nbsp; The headwind caused a few waves for the return leg, and
I think a few people swallowed water.&nbsp; I really quite enjoyed
the swim and being amongst the thick of the pack for a
change.&nbsp; Out of the water in 1.19.39 and into T1...&nbsp;</p>

<p>T1&nbsp; 5.21&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Special mention to T1 as all I could think about was Steve A who
would not have been impressed with my faffing!!!&nbsp; I tried my
best to be fast, but after hopping about trying to remove wetsuit,
throwing on some P20 to attempt to protect my delicate 'english
rose' skin from any more dodgy tan lines, I had no change of
clothes &amp; ran from the tent to my bike but still only managed a
5.21 transition.&nbsp; Sorry Steve...next year I'll manage a sub
3!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bike&nbsp; 6.44.35</p>

<p>Now where do I start with this... an emotional rollercoaster is
probably the best way to describe it.&nbsp; Maybe my memory of how
brilliant the ride was last year affected how I 'thought' I would
feel this time around, where as I should have treated this is a
completely new race, as indeed it was.&nbsp; Not only had the bike
route been changed, but the weather conditions were much different
from the calm sunny day the year before.&nbsp; The start of the
ride was absolutely fantastic and I loved doing the northern loop
(same as last years route), I was down on the tri bars and pushing
hard, enjoying 20+ mph riding and was way above my expected
average.&nbsp; This put me in great spirits as not only was I
faster, but the new southern loop that we were to ride twice was
promised by the organisers and many people who recce'd the course
to be much faster.&nbsp; Stupidly I started dreaming of possible
bike spilt times.&nbsp; We had been warned that although the
southern loop was fast, it was very open to wind, should there be
any on the day.&nbsp; I think the forecasts that morning were for
30-35 mph gusts, oh dear!&nbsp; The loops although circular seemed
to be a constant head wind, and where I should have been hitting
20mph I was struggling to stay at 13mph!&nbsp; It was hard work,
and the two downpours didn't help to lift peoples spirits.&nbsp;
Unfortunately I have to admit I hit a bad patch and was pretty
angry out on the bike from about 80+ miles, my spirits only being
lifted when I got to see my Mum and Dad, and the pirate feed
station who never failed to make me laugh &amp; give me a
boost.&nbsp; Looking back I'm pleased with my bike time, but
knowing I should have been at least 20 mins faster had just made me
frustrated.&nbsp; Someone said to me that everyone was in the same
position, but I wasn't there to race others, I was there to race
myself and be the best I could be.&nbsp; This was the best I could
be that day, and I don't think I could have gone any faster without
sacrificing the run.&nbsp; And if there is one thing I've learnt is
that in my opinion, the run is just as an important part of the
ironman as the ride.&nbsp; It amazes me how much time you can lose,
and just how many people walk the marathon after a strong bike
leg.&nbsp; To get a good time you've got to have packed your
running legs...&nbsp;</p>

<p>T2 4.23&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not sure how this took so long, change of socks and trainers,
knee support on and talked to a lady who was feeling sick and I was
off... (sorry again Steve!)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Run&nbsp; 4.25.26</p>

<p>I felt so happy to eventually finish the ride and hand my bike
over that I was elated to get out running.&nbsp; If I had been
invited on a bike ride by Chrissie Wellington herself right there
and then I would have told her to get stuffed (she was supporting
at IM Austria the same day...the chances were slim).&nbsp; This was
my discipline, the thing I had really worked hard on, and the proof
of how much training I had really done.&nbsp; There were no excuses
now, I hadn't got a cold or stomach bug, I hadn't had any
mechanical faults on the bike, now it was me against the course,
and I was in my element.&nbsp; It really hurt, but I wasn't going
to let it beat me, this is my favourite part!!&nbsp; The crowds,
Mum, Dad, Pirates, all there, all shouting and cheering, willing us
all forward, to do well, to finish, is what I love!&nbsp; Out on
the course I run by feel, I always run by feel, never by what a
watch or monitor tells me to do... I check my pace- 8.30 min miles
hmmm this is fast, the sun is back out and shining again and all I
can think is 'make hay while the sun shines' so this is what I
did.&nbsp; I knew I would slow at some point, but I might as well
make the most of being able to run whilst I could, first 10k was
comfortably under an hour, lots of loud music as I passed Notts
Forest ground made me run faster every time I passed it.&nbsp;
Pirates everywhere on the course and supporting, and although we
couldn't always muster words or high 5's, there were always grins
and thumbs up (well from most anyway).&nbsp; Walking only through
the aid stations for crisps, coke, oranges, bananas etc I was
quickly back to running again, this generally varied from between
9-11 min miles depending on how I felt and wind direction!&nbsp;
The run course is three out and back loops along a river and then
around the lake we swam in to the finishing chute.&nbsp; Running
past the finish chute (to set off on another loop) always made me
smile seeing peoples joy as they finished!&nbsp; I was so close to
getting on TV (they were filming for channel 4) as the motorbike
camera crew following me on the final mile to the finish they asked
if I was coming in to finish (big camera poised on back ready for
action) and I had to tell them I still had one loop to go... I was
tempted to say yes, run down the finish chute for a stupidly fast
fake finish time and then carry on and do another loop!&nbsp; Darn
my honesty!&nbsp; With that they drove off to film someone else's
special finishing moment.&nbsp; Now I had promised myself that if I
ran the first two loops I could walk a little on the third loop,
but as what always happens with me is when I realise I am close to
finishing a race (I say close, I still had 8 miles to run!) my legs
start to perk up and I feel stronger.&nbsp; This mental recharge I
get must be the buzz that gets me returning to these daft events,
as it seems to happen every time, and I forget the pain of the past
few hours and press on.&nbsp; The thoughts of walking were no
longer there, and I can see my Dad is amazed too.&nbsp; He could
see earlier that I was struggling and really fighting with myself
to keep up my pace, but I assured him I was feeling good and he
cheered me on!&nbsp; Mum of course was shouting, cheering and
filming all of the days events with her usual vigour and seems to
have endless confidence in my ability.&nbsp; I knew I was on for a
sub 14 and knew I had a comfortable 2 hour window to complete my
final 8 miles.&nbsp; It's a long day out there and I use a
different watch for swimming, and had reset my garmin after my bike
to run, so working out the complete time that had lapsed was hard,
especially in my oxygen depleted and exhausted brain.&nbsp; All I
knew was I wanted to finish before 8pm.&nbsp; With approx 4 miles
to go the man running behind me had the ingenious idea of asking a
spectator what the time was (this idea had genuinely not crossed my
mind!) and he replied with 'just gone 6pm'... what?!?!&nbsp; I was
beating my target, and not by a little, I was smashing it!&nbsp; I
picked up my pace (it's amazing what a possibility of a sub 13 can
do) and as I rounded the lake for the last time my Dad told me it
was 6.10, woohoo, less than 3 miles to go!&nbsp; I ran straight
past the last two aid stations knowing I had no need to waste any
further time getting any food or drink from them and carried on
running.&nbsp; Now I felt like I was flying, in reality I was only
doing 10 min miles, but I felt on top of the world.&nbsp; Final
mile with the headwind down to the finish I could hardly feel the
headwind, and as I saw the finish line approach I started to well
up, I honestly didn't know how I had managed to stay strong enough
for a sub 4.30 marathon and I was so so happy to be
finishing.&nbsp; As I start running down the finishing chute I'm
scanning the crowd for Mum and Dad and I see them, I stop and give
them both a big hug and kiss (and have a little cry.. what a girl!)
and then carry on to my finish line moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Finish Time 12.39.26&nbsp;</p>

<p>That feeling couldn't get much better.&nbsp; I exceeded all of
my expectations, had the most wonderful weekend with family and
friends, and learnt that I'm stronger than I ever imagined.&nbsp;
Life is truly what you make of it, and what you make happen, and I
look forward to more adventures in the future.&nbsp; Will there be
any more Ironman events... of course (Dad, you were right as
always), but I won't be doing this particular event again, I can
hang my hat up on this race for good...I'm an Outlaw and I'm
proud.&nbsp; Thank you Mum and Dad for your endless love, support
and encouragement, it means the world to me.&nbsp; Now on to some
new adventures!</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Difficult to imagine how triathlon could get any better than Challenge Roth.

Terrific course with massive enthusiastic crowd support and faultless organization. Roth should be on every triathlete's bucket-list.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>This is an initial overview of the day a more in--depth report
to follow</p>

<p><strong>Weather and conditions</strong></p>

<p>Water temperature 22.9 degrees. At 23.0 degrees they would have
banned wetsuits apparently. Forecast light wind and cloudy skies
with sunny intervals plus rain in the afternoon. In fact, it was
windy for the cycle but stayed dry all day. It was roasting hot for
the run so atheletes stuffed wet sponges under their tri-suits to
keep cool.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<p>Inevitably, one mulls over the seconds and minutes squandered
with errors and misfortune. Over the coming months we will all
calculate how much smaller our finish time could be next
time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jamie</strong> is a modest uncomplaining fellow but must
have been very disappointed to find his Spinergy front wheel was
not Roth-legal. He had to make do with my spare wheel that he had
never used before. &nbsp;This replacement wheel rode a bit lumpy
and the brake surface was uneven apparently. An amateur debut
Iron-distance sub-11 hour finish is almost unheard of, so Jamie is
very worthy of his best-in-club performance in this race.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong>(yours truly) wasted time by going astray
and nearly missing the swim exit. Should have done the
homework.</p>

<p>Storming bike. A dream-like cycling experience with glorious
surface and beautiful terrain plus thousands of adoring supporters.
Bike performed brilliantly. Wish I had a helmet-cam so I could
watch it over-and-over again for spin sessions.</p>

<p>Got severe abdominal pains and diarrhea throughout the run.
Maybe just too many gels and probably too many of the caffeinated
variety. Did most of the run with heart-rate in zone1, trying to
get digestion sorted. This had the benefit of avoiding dehydration
and exhaustion, so it was a strong enjoyable finish. This run time
was 46 minutes slower than standalone marathon time,
unfortunately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, well pleased with a sub-11 hour finish.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Anthony</strong> displayed enormous grit and
determination to finish a few seconds under 12 hours. This brave
effort was rewarded with an intravenous drip.</p>

<p>Anthony was hugely disadvantaged by starting in the final wave
with all the slow athletes. This meant a bike racking location far
away from the swim exit, so T1 was always going to be slow. Lack of
good swimmers to draft off meant a slow swim time.</p>

<p>Ant's cycle was excellent with a sub-6 hour time for the 112
miles. That new bike was worth every penny.</p>

<p>A decent run despite hot weather and digestion troubles.</p>

<p>A sub-12 hour finish for a debut Iron-distance race is awesome
for anyone who is not an ex-pro cyclist channel swimmer from
Australia. A good day at the office.</p>

<p><strong>John</strong> had a solid swim in approximately his
target time, 1:13. His day was messed-up by a puncture early in the
cycle that de-railed his effort to go sub-11 hours. The pit-stop
puncture repair failed and the tyre change ran into problems that
exhausted John's CO2 supply and he did most of the ride on a
semi-flat.</p>

<p>Despite the bad luck, John's 6:31 cycle and 4:30 run resulted in
a fast finish time of 12:22.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Mac</strong> was immense in the swim and was the
only "purple-head" I noticed overtake me. He started the cycle with
a 20-minute lead on me and many other "black-heads" from my wave.
These are the swim hat colours, by the way.</p>

<p>Steve's cycle was excellent despite severe low blood sugars. But
for that set-back, his cycle time could have been exceptional.</p>

<p>The run was a disappointment for Steve because of serious
nutrition and digestion issues. This prevented him achieving his
goal finish time by a very large margin. Nevertheless, this
short-12hour finish is really good.</p>

<p><strong>Steve B</strong> did a fast swim as expected, 1:08. This
was followed by a fast ride of 6:04, which presumably he thoroughly
enjoyed.</p>

<p>All nicely poised for a great finish time, but things went less
well on the run which took at least an hour longer than
planned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this was long-12 hour finish that many triathletes
could only dream of. Considering the terrible stress and worry
caused by an RTA a few days earlier, this is a result to be proud
of.</p>

<p><strong>Claire</strong> did a good swim of 1:20 and completed
all but the last few kilometers of the cycle. The cycle had become
really tough for Claire because of a nasty soft-tissue
strain/tear/injury of the leg. Claire would have made the cut-off
time for the cycle completion but there was no way she could have
run with that leg problem.</p>

<p>Claire had no choice but to withdraw from the race. She had
nothing to prove, having previously completed an Ironman. Best to
get the injury healed and compete another day. Commiserations.
Rotten bad luck that could have happened to any one of
us.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Beyond the Race</strong></p>

<p>Those of us competing are so lucky to have had the opportunity,
thanks to the great support of family, friends and our hosts at the
terrific accommodation. Well done to several people at MSTC who put
in a lot of effort to make all this happen.</p>

<p>Biggest thanks go to my lovely wife, Helen, for giving me her
blessing to do this event.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[After the last minute cancellation of Newhaven Triathlon a last minute decision was taken by Rob, Colin and myself to race the at the Sussex triathlon festival.  Due to other commitments we had to race the sprint distance rather than the Olympic on the Saturday which some other Mid Sussex members were taking part in.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Race day dawned and after driving home late the night before in
the torrential rain through flooded roads and with only four hours
sleep I was less than enthusiastic when I set off, a feeling which
seemed to be reflected by Rob when I picked him up and told him
that the website recommended grippy shoes to run on the very muddy
course.&nbsp; However, when we arrived the skies looked a bit bluer
and it was dry so our spirits were lifted.&nbsp; As the race was
quite close to home Colin managed to arrive with time to spare so
he decided to have a picnic in transition before the
race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start time arrived and we all got in the water between two
buoys, there were a lot of people and not much space so I decided
to be brave and get to the front of the swim and try not to think
too much about all the horror stories of people swimming over
you.&nbsp; I set off as quickly as I could on Rob's feet to try to
avoid the hoard of swimmers coming in from the right towards the
first buoy.&nbsp; The good thing about a sprint distance is that
you only have 750m to swim which meant&nbsp; the other five buoys
came round quickly and it was time to negotiate the giant step out
of the lake.&nbsp; As I ran the distance into transition I could
see Colin ahead of me, Rob and his bike had left transition by the
time I got there.</p>

<p>swim times being: Rob 13.39, Colin 14.41, Rachel 14.49.</p>

<p>As I set off on the bike I could just about see Colin but being
a proper cyclist he soon disappeared and I set about chasing down
as many of the people ahead of me as I could. &nbsp;I passed three
women quite early on and a fair few men but the course was very
lumpy and there were a lot of blind corners, so with the rain and
my usual cautious cycling I was doing my usual job of being
overtaken on the downhills and bends and having to work twice as
hard to catch up on the flats and uphills.&nbsp; Rob said after
that he didn't particularly like the bike due to the blind corners
but the thought of how much more I would hate it kept him
amused.&nbsp; Coming down the last downhill I was caught by two
ladies who were much braver than me, I managed to go back past them
on the climb afterwards but coming into transition we were all very
close together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bike splits were: Rob 40.35, Colin 40.41, Rachel 42.53.</p>

<p>I managed to get out of transition as the first lady but was
overtaken by one lady quite quickly, I hadn't studied the run route
and there was a small loop where the out and back overlapped and
Rob suddenly appeared coming the other way and was leading the
race, then not far behind was Colin.&nbsp; There was one horrendous
hill which was very muddy and slippery both on the way up and
down.&nbsp; I really struggled to run up this and that was when I
was overtaken by another lady which was quite disappointing but I
ran as fast as I could to the end and was delighted to be third
lady.&nbsp; Rob was delighted to be second male overall after being
overtaken on the run by an athlete that was not only a faster
runner, but also older than him, a very rare thing
indeed!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Run splits: Rob 21.07, Colin 23.29, Rachel 24.44.</p>

<p>I need also to point out that in contrast to our recent Olympic
race at Northampton where Colin beat Rob on the bike and in
transition Rob has taken the time to do some transition practice
and took great pleasure in pointing out to Colin that he also
managed to beat him in T1 and T2.&nbsp; As Colin pointed out to me,
Rob had said after Northampton that a few transition seconds
weren't really important but when Rob was the quickest at them they
suddenly became crucial.&nbsp; We stayed at the end for the
presentations as Rob was really looking forward to his moment on
the podium and despite his request to make a speech which was
ignored he will really be pleased to see his moment of fame on the
website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Overall times: Rob 1.16.43 (2<sup>nd</sup>), Colin 1.20.30
(10<sup>th</sup>), Rachel 1.23.58 (21<sup>st</sup>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>My Roth - Ant Grey</strong></p>

<p>I had been dreading the swim, so it was with quite a bit of
trepidation that I lined up for the start of the swim. The turn
around buoy the other side of a distant bridge looked very far
away. The swim went fairly well, although I seemed to have trouble
getting a draft from 'quick feet'. No sooner had I latched onto a
pair than the swimmer in question decided to meander off to the
bank or the middle.<br />
 I mostly found myself swimming in large 'empty pockets' of water,
maintaining (I thought) a relatively straight line to the markers.
The return was great once you got close to the start line I could
hear the commentator and cheers of the large crowd even through my
ear plugs.</p>

<p>I exited the water in a bit under 1:16 which was close to my
target time, what wasn't in my plan was the rather large T1
duration. It didn't help that my bike was almost as far away from
the changing tent as it could be. I took my time in T1 as well
ensuring there was enough comfort cream applied down below to last
the distance, along with a good dosage of sun tan lotion.</p>

<p>The bike course was excellent, I had to rein myself in a bit at
the start to keep to my target heart rate zone, although towards
the end of the bike course this wasn't a problem as tiredness did
that for me.<br />
 The support from the crowd was amazing, apparently local news and
radio reported that there were about 200,000 supporters in
attendance and they really did lift your spirits with their
enthusiastic support.<br />
 Lots of banging, drums, rattles, even old WWII air raid sirens. At
one particular stretch of the cycle course there were half a dozen
or more soldiers in uniform standing at attention saluting the
competitors.<br />
 Lots of supporters holding their hands out for flying fives, I
even had one guy running up one of the steep hills with me cheering
me on.<br />
 The Solaberg hill was amazing, there are barriers there to funnel
you through to a single lane. Supporters there are about 15-20 deep
on both sides and you hit this roller coaster of sound and emotion.
I choked a bit going up the hill the first time, it was all a bit
overwhelming.</p>

<p>The bike course is a bit open and unfortunately there was a bit
of a breeze which made it harder than it could of been. My time of
5:57 was a bit slower than the 5:40-5:45 that I had been planning
on doing.<br />
 Another slow transition followed, but this was partly my own doing
as I had a quick chat with Jon to find out why I had managed to
pass him towards the end of the cycle leg, and a quick trip to the
porta loo (sorry Dave, but I couldn't bring myself to utilise
'that' particular strategy on the bike course).</p>

<p>I started off fairly well on the run, having to try and hold
back a bit for my target 9:00 minute miles. Unfortunately the heat
and tired legs soon took their toll. I had planned on only walking
through the aid stations, but after the first 10Km I had made my
first walk of shame. The next 15Km were very hard for me although
the crowd were very uplifting with their support. With about 15 Km
to go I realised that a sub 12 hour time was still a possibility if
I pulled my finger out, queue a lot less walking. With 4 miles to
go the sub 12 was still on but there was no time now to walk
through the aid stations so I pressed on ignoring the offers of
drinks and sponges. By now my legs were all over the place, lots of
rippling muscle spasms running up and down my legs with each
stride. With less than a mile to go I had given up on my target
time and had started the walks of shame again. Before I knew it the
finish tunnel was within sight, 2 minutes to go, could I do
it?&nbsp; With what felt like a sprint, but in reality was simply a
fast shuffle, I charged up the red carpet finish loop, barging past
other competitors intent on crossing en-masse. To cheers from the
MSTC supporters crew I finished in under the 12 hours.
Unfortunately the last few miles had taken their toll so I was
rather unwell and had to go to the medical tent for an IV pick me
up!</p>

<p>I couldn't imagine being able to do such an event without the
help and support from the friends and family that were there to
support or compete, and also my own family back home for having put
up with my crazy training schedule over the last 7-8 months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>My Roth - Jamie Goodhead</strong></p>

<p>Not sure what I was more apprehensive about - a week in a
foreign country with my parents, three kids and wife or the
inspiration that is an Iron-distance triathlon after not having
participated in a triathlon for over 10 years. &nbsp;Anyway as I
couldn't decide I thought I may as well preoccupy myself with
thoughts pertaining to "will my bike actually survive easy jet?",
"will my kit be the oldest there?", "does Lycra disintegrate with
time?" and "will out of date gels make me sick?".<br />
<br />
 When I arrived at Munich Airport I was slightly perplexed by the
number of bikes from previous flights without owners - a friendly
German lady told me to think positively and she was right - out it
came in one piece. &nbsp; Despite my retro bike, kit and gels I
felt sufficiently prepared until I got to registration where I
found my front wheel had been made "illegal" - if work has taught
me one thing, it is that there is little point taking on a debate
with a German following "instructions" so I swallowed my pride and
gladly took the spare wheel on offer from Jim who had pretty much
two of everything! &nbsp; That exemplifies the week - everyone was
happy and helpful &nbsp;with Jim in the back ground fiddling with
his extra kit!<br />
<br />
 Now true fear started the day before the race - not so much about
the race itself but by leaving one's bike in the sun fully race
ready. &nbsp;As the sound of bursting tubs could be heard on the
walk back to car I had a night to ponder how I should go about
changing my tyre(s) in the morning in what may be a closed off
transition area. &nbsp;Thankfully all of our bikes were intact
although there were many a triathlete being informed to the
contrary over the tannoy.<br />
<br />
 I suppose you may be interested in the "race" (personally I'm not
sure anything over 5 hours is actually a "race"). &nbsp;To
summarise, it was ruthlessly efficient. &nbsp;I failed to see why
we needed to be there 2.5 hours early for the swim but ho hum,
sleep was not really happening. &nbsp;What a pleasant swim (aka
"warm-up") - no point killing oneself, I was happy to sit back,
watch the crowds and enjoy the moment - over too soon it was onto
the bike. &nbsp;180kms on tri-bars is not something I could imagine
or train for so I felt "winging it" was the only viable strategy
which seemed to work. &nbsp;I was terrified of being busted for
drafting and ending up in the "pit of shame" so I can honestly say
I have never been so "clean" in all my life and before I knew it I
was in T2 being helped by a German lady who &nbsp;was not the
slightest bit perplexed by my full frontal. &nbsp;Having enjoyed
the crowds and survived the wind / hills I was now looking forward
to a pleasant jog but by now the litre of fluid &amp; three gels
per hour &nbsp;were starting to catch up on me - 10kms later and a
bag of pix &amp; mix I reached for the salt tabs that Mr Mac had
given me the day before - they worked a treat, my stomache started
to empty and despite being a victim of TBC (Total Body Confusion) I
jogged on. &nbsp;The only conversation I had the whole day was
30kms into the run with Hans who told me he was "fxxx'd up bad" and
looking at him he was correct! &nbsp;An hour later it was all over
with a deceptive burst of speed down the finishing straight -
naturally my wife passed me the kids with a look that clearly meant
- "its your turn now"!<br />
<br />
 I would fully recommend this race / family holiday, that was made
all the more enjoyable with the cracking bunch from the club!!</p>

<p><strong>My Roth Claire Cresswell</strong></p>

<p><br />
 A little bit of my heart doesn't want me to write a race report.
However I am sitting with a huge smile on my face, another
adventure ticked off the box. Perhaps it might seem weird to you
that I am smiling as I didn't finish the Ironman. It doesn't to me,
from the minute I booked to do the second ironman I have been
excited.</p>

<p>We are going with Jamie, Jim, Jon, Steve B, Ant and Steve M.
What a team, no wonder I am excited. We are sharing a house and its
going to be great. I don't really know all the guys that well, so
it will be a great chance to spend some time with them and their
friends/families/loved ones some of which I do know like: Pippa,
Emma and Kay.</p>

<p>I know already the guys are going to "fly", such a wealth of
experience between them. I so enjoyed my first one last year.
Having a time of 15hrs 4 mins to beat was something I was hugely
aware of as Roth has the cut off of 15 hrs, not 17 hrs like
Austria. My training this year seemed more settled . . at
times.</p>

<p>Like anything that's a big sacrifice this year, this was no
different. A few 'hurdles', make the end challenge even more
appealing. Mine started with a lovely touch of bacterial sinusitis
and a remarkable cough that left me with a very husky voice - which
has been missed by a few of my patients!! This took me out of
training for about three weeks in a very pivotal time.</p>

<p>Then the information that we could represent GREAT BRITAIN that
felt at times like a noose around my neck was something that was
not deserved however hard not to cherish as a thank you for the
continued support to give back to my mum, dad, family and of course
Tim. Seeing "the Trisuit" with CRESSWELL GBR made me start to think
about why I race? Why I HAVE to keep challenging myself? Why do I
make life harder, by choosing an impossible distance to train to
and put myself under so much pressure? When in life most of my
other pleasures are escapism from pressure, gardening, painting,
cooking etc..</p>

<p>I know now why I did it. I rang my dad when I was having my leg
taped up in Germany.<br />
 "Hi Dad"<br />
 "Hi Clasmo"<br />
 "How's mum? how did the chemo go for her? "<br />
 "She fine-ish honey, we were more worried about you"<br />
 "ohh I am fine-ish "<br />
 "we could see that you only got to 108 miles on the bike, are you
sure you're ok?"<br />
 "Yes-ish, my leg got really painful dad, "I was having a ball" the
roads here, are like you said they would be FANTASTIC and mainly
flat if you take out the Solarberg and a few other hills"<br />
 "What's the solarberg, hon?"<br />
 "oh, so much to tell you, dad, the solarberg was awesome. You
could see it in the distance, the iconic hill that is littered with
supporters making enormous amounts of noise, banking drums,
whizzing rattles, you would have loved to have seen it, it looked
like something out of the tour de France. I couldn't see where my
path was. Only room for one bike UP and thick crowds of supporters
smacking you on the back, shouting HOP, HOP, Hop, Allez, Sooouper,
it was unreal. I had to keep one hand on the handlebars and the
other flicking my hand to indicate that they needed to get out of
the way as I was cycling on up. It was phenomenal the noise and
atmosphere was wild almost as noisy as the crowd at Foo Fighters
concert!&nbsp; You'll have to come with us next time dad. I am just
having my leg iced and then it's going to be strapped up - don't
worry though, all is good dad, all is good.<br />
 "So what happened?"<br />
 "well, I was really tinkering along for me and it was easy to do
at times as the roads were flat and I think that my vastas medialis
muscle (inner quad muscle) got very fatigued and I altered my
position on the bike and sat further back in the saddle. Then I
started getting, knee pain and my first ever sciatic pain for about
ten miles this didn't arrive until I had done 90 miles and the
constant pain in my knee was unbearable with every turn of the
leg"<br />
 "You should have just stopped, mum and I are very proud of you no
matter what you do"<br />
 "Dad, I couldn't just stop to begin with, the way my body manages
discomfort and pain is a part of what gets you over that finish
line, these events dad .they are tough, they are meant to break
you"<br />
 "Hmmm, Did you enjoy the swim?"<br />
 "It was great, a bit warm for wetsuits sitting just under
23degrees. I loved the swim. A very settling moment for a big
event, nothing can go wrong in the swim for me. It went so fast
dad. When I got a migraine from the pain in my leg and decided to
stop at the top of the hill after the solarberg, I couldn't take my
weight and decided very sensibly to stop a very close 4 miles from
finishing the bike, Tim bizarrely was there for me, I didn't see
him, but he was there for me with Kay and Mark"<br />
 "Cor, I bet you were knackered"<br />
 "No - full of energy - I think I might have to reserve that for
when the pain in my leg has gone"<br />
 "So, you will do another?"<br />
 "Oh, definitely Dad, I feel like this injury was a one off. This
is the distance I love, I do it because I can and it makes me so
happy"<br />
 "Did you learn anything about yourself today and did you enjoy
your time away with Tim and your friends?"<br />
 "Dad, it's been great, I know you wanted to be here and I am so
happy that you stayed with mum, she has been on my mind. We have
had the time of our lives, experienced so much in such a short time
with some really lovely remarkable people, so many stories to tell
and despite the possible grade 2 tear of rectus femoris, I am
happy"<br />
 "That's my girl, always happy to challenge yourself and that's
what makes us proud - sometimes darling , and you won't want to
hear this - you sometimes learn more about your direction in life
through not completing something.<br />
 "Umm, maybe, Dad this call is costing me the earth I am sure! The
guy has taped my leg know - beautiful bright pink tape. I am going
to ring Tim and he will wander back from the finish line to help me
see the guys cross the finish line, I can't wait to see them they
have been remarkable"<br />
 "Ok, remember to be proud, you still did a superb job, you don't
sound tired after doing 108 miles&nbsp; ...<br />
 "I know I am not tired, my leg hurts Dad.I can't straighten it,
the pain was just too much"<br />
 "Claire, you're just human and what you did was just one day out
of your whole life, and honey, you would have finished easily the
bike in time, so be proud ok? Ok? We have checked your cats, there
fine and we will see you when you get home. Goodbye Love - Everyone
from the family sends there love to you and Tim.<br />
 "Thanks Dad, I Love you, see you soon"</p>

<p>I can't change what has happened, and having the ultrasound
(with the confirmed partial tear in the hamstrings) isn't great. I
am "behaving" and walking around the pool for twenty minutes
everyday and nearly causing lots of accidents with the crutches has
made me realise that it won't be the last IM . just a little hiccup
on route to the next.</p>

<p>Well Done to the super incredible Jamie, Jim, Ant, Steve B, Jon
and Steve M You were all amazing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>My Roth Steve Mac</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>The preparation</strong></em></p>

<p>This was to be my A race for the year. After a lot of hard
training I was feeling good so I decided that Roth 2012 would be my
chance to lay down my fastest time. Also it was to be the European
Championships and I could be representing Ireland. With the other
MSTC competitors representing GB, I could envisage that with us all
in our kit, this could make for a great photo.</p>

<p>Every time I think about Roth I get butterflies. Can I really do
it? Of course, after all, I have done this distance before in the
Switzerland Ironman. Well, that's what I keep telling myself. Swim
- no bother, bike - after the Mont Blanc training camp no worries
and as for the run - although I have never been a keen runner I
have really focused on it in this time and am as confident as I
have ever been. I am actually looking forward to it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Arrival in Germany</strong></em></p>

<p>We arrive on the Thursday and are sharing a very large house
with some great club members. Lots of nervous energy and lots of
banter; which is a great lead up.</p>

<p>We arrive at registration which in typical German fashion goes
very smoothly. Believe it or not we are the first in line. Okay, I
admit this is only because we set off 2 hrs earlier to do a test
swim but could not find the start, but did find the registration
tent! It is also at this point that Jamie discovers he is illegal.
Well his front wheel is&nbsp; anyway.</p>

<p><br />
 The next day we are out driving the bike course when unfortunately
Steve and Pippa are involved in a road traffic accident. Everyone
is ok but as the car badly damaged this cannot be a good place for
your mind to be 2 days before a big race. With the incident taking
place at a crossroads, the locals come out to see the incident and
despite speaking little or no English (matched equally by our
limited German), they bring out coffee and cakes for us all. They
are great people and this really warms the spirit despite the
distressing<br />
 circumstances.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Big Day</strong></em></p>

<p>Breakfast at 03:00 and I'm feeling refreshed and invigorated
after a great night's sleep... &nbsp;I wish. Thankfully I am too
nervous to feel tired. Well how else are you supposed to feel at
03:00 in the morning after an hour or two of sleep?</p>

<p><em><strong>Swim 3.8km&nbsp; 01:00:05</strong></em></p>

<p>The swim is great as I knew it would be. All the anticipation
and all the nerves just melt away when I pull my wetsuit over my
shoulders and zip it up. Now it's time to race, I tell myself. Up
to this point I am pretty unfocused as my way to chill is to talk
to people and have the craic.</p>

<p>In the water on the front line BOOOOM a hugh cannon goes off to
signal my wave start. Well this is a surprise, normally its a bun
fight at the start, but this one goes really well. I am in the lead
pack but they are going way too fast so I back off and really start
to enjoy the swim. I spot another person off the pack who is
swimming a bit quicker than me so I latch onto his slip stream and
cruise along at his faster pace but putting in less effort.</p>

<p>We come across and pass 3 other waves I realise that I have
passed Jon and Jim. That's great as I need a big lead on them for
the bike. Before I know it its time for the fun to end and get onto
some serious racing.</p>

<p>Out of the swim with a time of 01:00:05 - where the hell did
those 5 seconds come from??</p>

<p><em><strong>T1 03:36</strong></em></p>

<p>Out of the wetsuit and pull bike shorts over the tri suit and
out, but quickly have to go back to get sun block rubbed into
me.</p>

<p><em><strong>Bike 180km 06:12:00</strong></em></p>

<p>Out on the bike feeling great. The first couple of miles are
quite twisty and mainly downhill and quite soon we travel through
the army "ration station". We are being saluted by soldiers either
side of the road which is quite unusual. I come across 'beer miles'
all over the route and note that it is very well supported.</p>

<p>It is however windy, very windy. When the head wind stops, it
simply moves to the side and tries to push you off, then turns back
into a head wind again, especially towards Greding. The bike route
is subsequently described by the race organiser as having the most
difficult conditions he had known in fifteen years, due to cross
winds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that said, my extra training at David Jones Mont Blanc
training camp has paid off as I barely notice any hills and storm
the twisty descent with switchbacks. I overtake the more cautious
riders and this becomes one of the highlights of my race,
overshadowed only by the famous Solarberg climb. On its own, this
would be a relatively minor climb. But with a crowd of
20,000-30,000 standing 10 deep and lining the road like a Tour
mountain stage in the Pyrenees, it is something special that will
remain in my memory for life. The climb is as<br />
 I said minor and I approach it with a heart rate of 75%. However,
this jumps quickly to 90+% half way up. Not due to the excursion
but just the pure buzz and energy from the crowd. You cannot see
the road for spectators and have to play chicken with them as they
part inches in front of you. With your heart pumping and your ears
ringing with their huge cheers, it is truly amazing.</p>

<p>I gradually realise that I am becoming dehydrated, I haven't
peed at all even though I am drinking over a bottle an hour. It
transpires that unfortunately this becomes my undoing as I
subsequently suffer a large crash in my blood sugars. Even though
my feeding regime is tried and tested, they drop to dangerously low
levels so I have to revert to my backup emergency feeding plan...
bolt down as much glucose as possible. Unfortunately even this
doesn't work. &nbsp;However, I do see a tiny increase which helps,
so rather than withdraw I decide to back off on the bike, so I can
at least begin the run and then see what happens.</p>

<p>Bike target was 05:50:00 but 06:12:00 is ok. Avg speed:18mph</p>

<p><em>I believe (and expect to have it confirmed) that due to the
dehydration, my body could not absorb the glucose properly,
possibly from a liver malfunction. So a lesson learned
for</em><br />
 <em>all, drink, drink and drink some more.</em></p>

<p><em>Belinda Granger (in her 11th year) said the bike conditions
were the slowest that she had</em><br />
 <em>experienced at Roth. It doesn't detract from my disappointment
of hitting my time goals, but it does help explain some of the
difference.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>T2 03:33</strong></em></p>

<p>Out of the bike shorts and more lotion rubbed into me whilst I
try to get my head into the right place.</p>

<p><em><strong>Run 42.2km 05:09:47</strong></em></p>

<p>Believe it or not I am actually looking forward to the run. I
have worked really hard for 6 months with Coach DJ and I have
improved massively. So I am set for a 4hr marathon, which is an
achievable goal. &nbsp;I start the run and it quickly becomes
apparent that this may actually be an unachievable goal, but I
refuse to accept it. I take inspiration from the pros who are
passing me in the opposite direction heading to the finish. I see
the pain and effort etched into their faces, so it is time for me
to dig deep. 'Biodh an misnech' is a Gaelic phrase I have tattooed
on my leg (it means Have the Courage) so it is time to zip up the
man suit and fight the urge to slow down.</p>

<p>The minimal cloud cover that has been present for most of the
bike rolls away just in time for the run, and it is going to be a
hot one. My blood sugar levels are slightly up at around 4mmol's.
For non-diabetics they would be 6ish and collapsing can happen at
about 2mmol's, so I needed to keep a close watch on them. I decide
to walk every aid station and get as much liquid down as possible.
They are giving out half full 300ml cups of coke, water or iso
drink and soup. Soup, in this heat?? Madness!. I end up grabbing
either the iso or water and by adding it to a coke this works well
and stays down. Unfortunately I am still very dehydrated.</p>

<p>I back off &nbsp;the 9 min miles after about 3 miles and settle
into 10's and then 11's. The aid station 'walks' are also becoming
longer as the course progresses and cramps are setting in all over
my body. Even in my forearms, I didn't know they could cramp!</p>

<p>The climb back into Roth with 4km to go is hard, although it
probably isn't even that steep. Then with relief, I am into the
last 3km around the town. Passing the spectators cheering from
their beer tables is amazing and it is quite surprising how much
that lifts me. It is the final kilometre and am approaching the
finishing chute when I see Kay. She joins me and we run down the
chute side by side giving a few high-fives to the crowd cheering
from the<br />
 stands either side. As I see the MTSC shirted supporters and the
Irish flags waving frantically. I cross the line with Kay hands
raised, before almost collapsing into her arms. Another memory that
will never fade.</p>

<p><strong>Finish 226km 12:29:00</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Reflection</strong></em></p>

<p>I didn't hit my 11hr goal time but am ecstatic to have finished,
as I know doing the distance is something everyone should be proud
of and I am pretty chuffed with certain elements of my performance.
Swim was where it should be, bike was fairly well paced -<br />
 and the consensus seems to be that the wind made the bike a lot
harder than normal, maybe 10-15 minutes slower. The run was bad,
very bad, but I survived. I had many internal arguments about
ditching my number and binning the whole thing, 'Biodh an misnech'
was my response. So thankfully I didn't although it was a close
call.</p>

<p>My blood sugars remained low throughout but again I am still
here. On reflection to continue was a dangerous decision to make
and it could have easily gone very wrong, There were quite a few
scattered bodies on the run all receiving attention and it would
not have been nice to be counted among them, If another diabetic
had told me this story on the run, I would have tried to stop them.
For me I think it was the right decision. I had trained for things
like that and made allowances in my training for 'What if's.
Unfortunately that all came into play but things go wrong in all
races, especially in ones of this distance. You have to be flexible
and adapt. If you can't adapt you won't finish. I was flexible and
did<br />
 adapt.</p>

<p>I probably should have gone to the medical tent to get
rehydrated (I didn't wee for quite a few hours after and felt very
rough for a few days) but I was slightly distracted by the communal
changing/shower rooms....a very strange experience.</p>

<p>Roth as a race is amazing and probably the best experience you
are likely to have at a long<br />
 distance triathlon. The spectators were unbelievable and I am sure
we all have loads of stories about our individual interactions with
them. The banter, support and help from the fellow MSTC team out
there were great and David Jones's coaching is inspiring. But most
of all the love and support from Kay is as always amazing I am a
very lucky man.</p>

<p><strong>MSTC welcome Leicester Tri as Sun
Shines</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46 athletes in total took part in the second MSTC Olympic Race,
including 11 guests from Leicester Tri Club. It was a glorious day,
probably about as perfect as it could be to race any triathlon. The
lake was beautiful, the bike route challenging and the run route
wet and muddy, so something for everyone!!</p>

<p>Setting everything up from scratch only caused a small delay and
the race got underway about 7.45am, but not before the race
briefing. Martin Shoesmith was very pleased he attended as he
discovered the new relay rules might affect him. To keep everything
fair the relay swimmer had to completely remove their wetsuit in T1
before tagging the cyclist. Unfortunately Martin likes that nice
feel of rubber against his skin, and has recently been swimming
'commando' - luckily he had to time to rectify the situation
without being DQ'd for being 'tackle out in
transition!!!'&nbsp;</p>

<p>The standard at the front of the swim is almost unbelievable
these days. Dave Gorley from Leicester was out in 22.43, almost 2
minutes ahead of Neil who was just seconds ahead of Phil Couch, Mat
Record and Mark Jordan (who found Mat's feet and tickled them all
the way round - so excellent drafting!) in 24.35 and all 39
starters were out of the lake in under 40 minutes. Fastest lady out
of the water was Hazel in 27.25, with Rachel about a minute
behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most people got through T1 without incident, except Dave
Lashbrook who lost his footing as he was running out with his bike
and fell quite heavily. Remarkably he just got up, dusted himself
down and carried on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the bike route 2 people punctured. Martin Sanwell was at
least prepared and had all the kit with him. He lost a lot of time
but still continued to race. Nick Deakin from Leicester punctured
quite early, along Sunte Avenue, but did not have any kit with him.
Fortunately a Good Samaritan was on hand in the form of Tim
Cresswell, who gave him a spare tube and got him back on his
way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As any regular readers of my reports will know there are 2
things that are usually open to mocking and ridicule. One is way
too long transitions (I can't criticize anyone today as we can't
have transition splits) and the other is avoidable mechanical
issues (usually Ant!). Ant was very quick to point out that he
passed someone at the side of the road (as did about 10 others) in
a black aero helmet trying to fix his Cervelo. Yes, that was me,
and to make matters worse it was pretty much the same problem I had
last year on the same circuit!! All I can say is that at least I
had the problem this week so things should be fine for the big race
next weekend - but it was still avoidable!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As usual James had the fastest bike split, but he was only 23
seconds faster than Neil, and Dave Jones only one minute back, so
both Neil and Dave kept ahead of James into T2, with Dave Gorley of
Leicester just behind. Rachel overhauled Hazel to take the lead in
the ladies race with Emma Tilbury from Leicester maintaining her
3<sup>rd</sup> place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>T2 was fairly uneventful and again we cannot have the time
splits. The run however was quite interesting considering it is a
fairly flat, accurately measured 10km. It was remarkably muddy
which certainly slowed down the fast runners, although Neil still
managed to break 40 minutes and 10 runners broke 45 minutes. The
route was fairly straightforward - with 2 arrows and a giant yellow
blob on the ground marking the turn point. Mike Jaffe did manage to
miss all of this and carried on to check out the scenery round the
next corner before he realized his mistake. He got it right on the
second lap however! The deep mud pulled off one of Loz's shoes, but
Rachel went one better by losing both.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end Neil won comfortably in 2.15.05 nearly 4 minutes
clear of Dave Jones, who was a further 3 minutes clear of Dave
Gorley, with James just seconds behind. Rachel had a comfortable
win in the ladies race in spite of losing her shoes and finished
about 4 minutes ahead of Hazel who was well clear of Lucy in
3rd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Toby wrote a nice piece about his race so I have included it -
thanks Toby&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve - here's some of my thoughts from the rear...</p>

<p><strong>Toby</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With two late night social events on both Friday and Saturday,
hauling myself out of bed at 5.45 Sunday morning felt like a major
challenge in itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ardingly reservoir, was stunning
in the early morning light, mist hanging over the water, geese
flying overhead and the rising sun glinting off an intimidating
array of bikes which made the Tour de France look positively stone
age. It was reassuring to chat with a couple of other relative
newbies and find them equally daunted by the task ahead. But the
relaxed briefing and friendly vibe helped steady the nerves and
soon enough we're in the water and off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a bit of a panicky moment during an open water swim
recently, and have learnt to take it slow and steady, concentrating
on my stroke, conserving energy and making sure I don't get out of
breath. This works well except for the minor problem that it means
I end up going rather slowly. I'm one of the last out the water.
&nbsp;Never mind I am feeling good and have only lost a few
minutes...I can catch up on the bike. I set off in a group of four,
all fairly close together. But fairly quickly the other three start
to move away from me. Bugger. I know the first part of the bike
route is mostly uphill, having ridden part of it recently in
training. So I was happy to push fairly hard (for me), looking
forward to the second part of the course, which I logically assumed
would be mostly downhill. Oh dear. I don't really understand the
physics involved but somehow the route managed to be mostly uphill
all the way round. Luckily I managed to get myself into a nice
little battle with another rider (sorry didn't get your name) which
helped push me along. Unluckily this meant I hadn't conserved any
energy for the final challenge (and my triathlon nemesis). The
run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm a crap enough runner at the best of times and even the
(greatly appreciated) gentle encouragement of Alan and Margaret
during Thursday night's winter training haven't turned me into
anything more than a steady plodder. Never mind - it's a nice flat
route isn't it? Oh dear again. Mud. The course (out and back twice)
was nicely designed to let me see all the front runners sprinting
impressively towards the finish, as I'm just setting out. Anybody I
had managed to pass on the bike came past me fairly quickly on the
run and I just had to revert to my usual triathlon run tactic.
&nbsp;Try and keep moving, attempt to take on gels without throwing
up and don't think about how far I still have to go. I had set some
target times for myself, but with the hills and mud these were
quickly out of the window and I was just aiming to finish! Special
thanks to Steve Mcmenamin for telling me I was 'looking good' as I
started my (fairly lonely by now) second lap. Obviously complete
bollocks, I looked and felt like shit at that point, &nbsp;but it
was said with a smile and every little bit helps! In the end I was
quite a bit slower than I'd hoped, but hey, this is a long term
project for me. Incremental improvement is my aim. Just wait and
see what I can do in 2017...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good to see my fellow newcomer Julie coming in behind me to
complete her first Olympic distance. I suspect without the problem
she'd had with her knee she may well have caught me on the
run!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to Steve Alden and others that organized the event. I
really enjoyed it. Mostly. It's great to be in a club that manages
to mix friendly encouragement for the part timers like me with some
very serious, competitive and inspirational performances from the
front runners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the race was over we had a glorious day to enjoy a BBQ with
all the team from Leicester. The new Inter Club Challenge was won
comfortably by MSTC - although I don't think anyone apart from
Steve Mac knew there was a trophy! It was great to make friends
with other triathletes and hopefully this may form a pattern for
the future.&nbsp;</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p style="text-align: center;">WARNING DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME</p>

<p>The below event was completed by a non trained triathlete so you
don't have to go through the same pain</p>

<p>First thoughts of the weekend were:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Why?</li>

<li>When was this a good idea?</li>
</ul>

<p>The race brief described an 'Event village'. Trade descriptions
act was being broken there I think. 2 tents in a field with some
racking didn't instil me with confidence.</p>

<p>Quick drive of the bike course made the confidence rise slightly
until the last 2k and a big hill appears. What made it worse was
the realisation that I had to do it 3 times.</p>

<p><strong>Race Day</strong></p>

<p>4:40 is an ungodly hour FACT. Breakfast at that time is even
harder, what makes it worse is the sight of late night revellers
sharing breakfast with you and thinking that used to be me.</p>

<p>What a difference an afternoon made. When arriving at 6 the
place was fully set up looking much more pro than the day before.
199 competitors who looked like they knew what they were doing, and
me. A quick 'morning' to Phil Graves completed my time bumbling
around transition.</p>

<p>I never realised how quick the last hour before start can go.
Off to the lake we went. The sun was out the lake looked great, a
quick brief and it was no turning back 'get in and warm up'.</p>

<p>Now I've never done mass start races before. Where do you go?
Back,side, in the middle. I opted for holding back and went off
steady. To my surprise my steady was much faster than most of the
people in front of me. Oh well best go over the top then.
Everything came together; I could sight and keep pace. The last
200m was into the sun so you couldn't see the last 10ft long 5ft
high marker buoy, act like a sheep and follow the others.</p>

<p>I got a great helping hand out of the water in a very
respectable time of 20 mins. The first thing I see is Claire
beaming at me (damn better run into transition then).</p>

<p>Transition wasn't a great performance, being a bit of a tart it
was on with the socks, on with more padded shorts and off.</p>

<p>Now I haven't cycled 60 miles before so I was a bit worried
about that. Head down and stare at the computer telling me the
average speed. Keep that at over 15mph and I'm doing well. End of
the first lap and the hill appeared from round a corner. Just to
make it worse the camera man was half way up the hill. I thought it
only fitting to call him an evil sod.</p>

<p>I now have respect for the ability to eat whilst cycling. How do
you peel a banana at 20 mph? Badly, seemed to be the answer. The
only option was smack it on the tri bar and suck the mush out, well
it made a difference to gel after gel</p>

<p>The best bit of the cycle is the last 5k back to the
start/finish. I had fresh tape on the tri bars and came through the
line to Claire's shouts of encouragement at nearly 30mph in the
best aero position a 14 stone man can get into.</p>

<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> laps aim was to do it in the same time, I was
5 mins slower so not too shabby. The 3<sup>rd</sup> small loop was
spent thinking 'can I run after this, is there anything left?'</p>

<p>Quick bit of Webster's factor 100 and I'm off for an afternoon
run in the sun. Well those of you that know me know how much I LOVE
running!</p>

<p>It started well for the first 2k, after that my shins hurt like
hell and forced the walk of shame. Still my best discipline. Could
I do 3 laps of this? Damn right I could, I'd got this far and I
wasn't stopping now. 2 laps down and the pain got greater but the
speed walk got faster.</p>

<p>Now I had read the race website where it said how to get the
best photo, so in the last 100m before you turned into the
finishing Shute the glasses came off the hat was adjusted. The
marshals said 'You wanna look good for the finish line'. The only
thing that came to mind was saying 'Does my bum look big in
this?'</p>

<p>Turning the last corner was great, red carpet pom pom girls and
people shouting your name. I had done it, the fat bloke from
Hassocks who swims, cycles and runs a bit completed the longest
race of his life with a genuine smile on his face 5hrs 31mins
later. Claire was there patiently waiting to cheer me over the
line.</p>

<p>I didn't need to worry about here being lonely for 5hrs. She was
talking to all the pros from all over the world. But never fear the
fat man in a tri suite will be with you soon.</p>

<p>Being told well done from an Aussie pro that Claire had been
talking to was a nice moment for me, these guys are all so down to
earth.</p>

<p>I would recommend this race to anyone who doesn't like a long
run. It was amazing to do and complete.</p>

<p>I would just say don't try this without any training, I did and
it hurts&nbsp; A LOT</p>

<p>Final times</p>

<ul>
<li>20mins 50 secs swim</li>

<li>3hr 45mins
bike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>1hr 10mins run</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Total 5hr 31ins</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[4 foolhardy MSTC athletes coaxed their aged and reluctant minds and bodies into a daring challenge of endurance and bike handling. David Jones, Jim Graham, Rupert Robinson and Loz were these brave cyclists.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>The most recent long distance BAR event was the Southern
Counties 100 mile time trial. As is customary the event was held at
a time on a Sunday morning when most normal people would be in a
restful state of slumber and dreaming of a slow transition to
partial wakefulness, Sunday papers and a fry up. Instead 4
foolhardy MSTC athletes coaxed their aged and reluctant minds and
bodies into a daring challenge of endurance and bike handling.
David Jones, Jim Graham, Rupert Robinson and I were these brave
cyclists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The course is rather peculiar in the number of roundabouts you
encounter with 52 roundabout junctions in the first 56 miles. It is
also unusual in having a major intersection with traffic lights at
60 miles. If you get stopped by the lights you have to stop
(obviously) or be dq'ed or run over. If you are unlucky enough (and
I was) to just get the lights going red you can wait for up to 2
minutes 40 seconds (I am sad enough to go back and time it). The
course continues to be a typical in that it then does 2½ laps of a
circuit that incorporates some very rolling and poorly surfaced
single carriageway. This makes for a proper test of man and bike (I
say this as no women entered the event because they have a good
deal more sense).</p>

<p><strong>Jim's story..</strong></p>

<p>The 100 mile TT was a reality check for me. I plodded along for
50 miles at 20mph (quite decent by my standards) but got overtaken
by dozens of riders doing 25mph. I overtook nobody. I then took a
wrong turn and did 25 miles of the previous section of the course.
When I eventually started the second half of the course I appeared
to be right at the back of the pack and felt rather fed up so I
retired. At about half-way the finish was sign-posted and I thought
it best to attend to domestic commitments rather than get home a
couple of hours later than promised.</p>

<p>Cycling on busy A-roads was a bit scary but it was a good
training session. I hadn't appreciated how many great amateur
cyclists there are out there. Shame I'm not one of them.</p>

<p>If I did it again, I would taper training properly to have fresh
legs and use my best bike with a disc. I would also have the route
properly mapped out on my garmin as route is a bit complicated and
easy to take a wrong turn.</p>

<p>May I add that Jim was going quite well and underestimates his
athletic prowess? However, he also underestimates his navigational
abilities and puts himself as a frontrunner in theForestGump prize
category for end of season awards. Had he not attended to "domestic
duties" he would have completed 137 miles!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rupert's story.</strong></p>

<p>For me I was aiming for Sub 4.10, wanting to beat my time from
last year. I uploaded the ghost rider from last year to race my
Garmin. I was seven minutes from the scratch man&nbsp;(for those
not familiar with this term it refers to the fastest rider on
previous performances not someone who provides a rough post race
massage) &amp; I wondered how long I would keep him off&nbsp; my
back.<br />
<br />
The first two laps of the usual Crawley 25 mile course went well
with my average speed staying around 25 mph despite the
headwind.<br />
<br />
As I was approaching the Shell Garage towards the 52 mile
mark&nbsp; the heavens opened - it was like being on a boat, making
riding up the hill increasingly difficult.<br />
<br />
I was pleased to pass the 56 mile mark at Southwater feeling like I
was at the half way point. It was just after this that Rob caught
me for 7 mins. I tried to hang on &amp; we both got stopped at the
traffic lights. I was off like a bullet out of a gun only to be
passed by Rob again on that long drag up towards Washington.<br />
<br />
This was when I had my first signs of cramp. Going too hard from
the traffic lights suddenly made me pay, when will I learn! The two
laps through Ashington and Patridge green&nbsp;were lumpy but the
tailwind helped the miles pass by.<br />
<br />
My average speed had dropped to 24.1 in the remaining two laps but
I knew I was on for a PB especially when I saw Dave Jones
ahead.<br />
<br />
Dave had started 19 minutes in front of me&nbsp;and this spurred me
on so that I could finish in the time I wanted.<br />
<br />
9th - a PB- 5th year on the bounce- 4.09.43!<br />
<br />
Man my undercarriage was sore!</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Dave's story..</strong></p>

<p>I spoke to the Mr Stealth (after all he is near silent and
deadly fast) about his ride. He was as enigmatic as ever and
looking as fresh as if he had just gone for a Sunday morning
amble.</p>

<p>Dave told me that he enjoyed the last 40 miles as he was tucking
into the ample post race refreshments. Clearly he had been riding a
different race - I suspect that he was using this race as training
for something much more substantial. It would not surprise me if we
saw our training guru going for something ironlike in the near
future and that will be very interesting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Loz's story</strong></p>

<p>I really was using this race as training in my build up for the
night time Half Ironman I will be doing in glamorous Dartford. As
usual I had decided to rebuild my bike late the evening before the
race and was pleased with the loan from Jon Webster of his
speedfill drinking system. This ingenious device is a large flat
triangle shaped bottle that fits on the downtube of the bike with a
long straw that you zip tie so that it dangles from the tribars
near your face meaning you are reminded to drink regularly and can
remain aero whilst doing so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was riding without any support (Rupert and Dave were getting
drinks handed up by Doug) and was testing my theory that 1.25
litres of High 10 (twice as strong as High 5) would be enough to
rehydrate and fuel me. I had read an interesting article on taking
the minimum amount of liquid you need in long distance events to
prevent gastrointestinal shutdown (and consequently bonk) when
entering the run of a long distance triathlon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My prerace routine (no warm up, visit loo, accidentally let air
out of tyres with track pump, visit loo, pour sticky energy drink
over my bike and legs, visit loo) had gone seamlessly. As I rushed
to the start I was aware of an unpleasant feeling between my legs.
I ignored it as I headed to the start keeper with 20 seconds to
spare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5,4,3,2,1, go.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to work out this annoying pain. The
filler cap of the speedfil was catching my knee on every
revolution. I spent the next couple of miles working out that if I
averaged 80 rpm and was going to be cycling for about 250 minutes I
would be slowly eroding my knee 20,000 times. I really should try
these things before a race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still the rough road surface at 5 miles meant I could refocus on
the job of keeping my disintegrating tribars (didn't quite tighten
the bolts properly) from falling into my front wheel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next 95 miles were a case of ignoring which bits hurt most -
my undercarriage, my knee, my legs or my head.</p>

<p>Rupert was going like a train and ahead of me at 50 miles and I
was pleased that my legs didn't fail me on the last circuit to
finish just over a minute in front of him. It was probably my
increasing power to weight ratio as I decreased my weight through
skin erosion and dehydration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was then a pleasant tailwind for the 4 mile ride back to
the HQ where I quickly donned my trainers to see if I could run for
an hour after the bike. I could - with the thoughts of post race
cake delights urging me on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I have learnt that:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>I should build and test my bike and hydration kit before race
day.</li>

<li>You can do 5 hours of exercise on 1.25 litres of drink but
preferably if there is a very well catered tea and cake venue where
you finish.</li>

<li>Riding on a dual carriageway in the rain is no sensible way to
spend Sunday morning.</li>

<li>It's great when it is over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both Rob and Neil qualified directly for the European
Championships with Rachael as 1<sup>st</sup> reserve Steve is also
a reserve on the waiting list with the other all fairing very well
and flying the club flag but being just outside of the selection
group but may get in on the roll down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A race that is well worth doing if you are in the area or are
happy to travel the distance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bedford - it's a pleasant kind of place - or so it seemed in the
small amount that we were exposed to. Nestled in between ring roads
and out of town shopping centers lay the embankment, a park with a
clean straight river with limited weeds, friendly fowl, lots of
green areas, a tarmac covered path around the perimeter and men in
shorts and compression tights. Almost a perfect setting for a
triathlon.</p>

<p>So seven of MSTC's finest and Colin set of in search or glory or
humiliation in a field where over half of the competitors were to
finish in less that 2hours 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lawrence was unfortunately unable to start, being a fine family
man Lawrence decided to bring his family and after an unfortunate
family accident followed by an afternoon in A&amp;E Loz was not
able to start, but child and dad are ok. (post event note - Loz
chose not to take his family to the Worthing Tri and managed to
start the event)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tents were erected and advice was sought from two of MSTC best
know members as to how to best to prepare for the most competitive
race of the season - off to the pub is the unanimous retort, yep it
may be counter intuitive but bladder and intestine loading is the
way to go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A question arises; Should you take your family to a triathlon
(so far it would seem the answer is one vote for no and none for
yes) - when this is asked of you what goes through your mind, will
they:&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(a)&nbsp; cramp my style</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(b) &nbsp;get in the way</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(c)&nbsp; &nbsp;affect my
preparation</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(d)&nbsp; &nbsp;result in an
afternoon in hospital and a DNS</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(e)&nbsp; &nbsp;cost too much</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;affect my
performance</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(g)&nbsp; &nbsp;prevent me from
sharing a tent with three fit members of the opposite sex who have
just downed a load of beer, are testosterone loaded and hyped up
for the race of their year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rachael considered the options very carefully! - 2-0 in favour
of leaving the family at home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was an early start, so late to bed - yep counter intuitive
again. Neil chose a remote location away from Tent de Rachael
worried that too much noise may keep him up and ruin his
race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was quite right - Robs flatulence was thunderous as methane
bazookas echoed around the campsite accompanied by teenage laughter
from the blokes and telling off from Rachael - it was going to be a
long night for us all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the three bladder and intestine loaded men were shepherded
and zipped into the holding pens located at each end of the tent
Rachael monitored the door and the emergency escape route, a good
idea - or was it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the noise subsided all were gassed into a restless sleep with
the odd groan of 'get of' and 'yes of course I love you, now go to
sleep' coming from one of the holding pens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two hours later it dawned on the blokes - not the sunrise - the
bladder, gently sloshing as it was pressed down on cold hard soil
or spiky vertebrate.</p>

<p>What to do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tough men are turned to pulp at the thought of having to wake a
sleeping woman in the middle of the night - so they lay there
zipped in their pens trying to ignore their bloating and expanding
abdomens as the exit continued to be &nbsp;guarded by slumber. 'You
will not pass' Gandalf's staff pushed gently into the bladder 'You
will not pass' another jab from the staff as stars of pain appeared
before our eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sh----------t&nbsp; sh-------t I can t take it any more, I am
sure Terry Waite's captivity went quicker than those few hours
lying there wide awake with a pulsating melon in your pants
expanding as it sucks up moisture from a hidden oasis of
beer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Is any one awake' a voice as puny as a baby smeagol on horse
tranquilizers gently filters through the nylon of the holding pen,
the sound came from a creature so rancid, its body pulsating with
pain, devoid of testosterone and scared sh---tless of the possible
consequences of waking the guardian of the tent - once more just in
case 'is any one awake'&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Yes'&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'What?'&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">''Yes'&nbsp;</p>

<p>It wakes -&nbsp;</p>

<p>A butterfly fluttered somewhere in northern Uzbekistan - the
holding pens were ripped apart as three grown men trampled
uncontrollably over a helpless prostrate female, flung themselves
in to the open air entered Modor, scaled Mount Doom and threw their
precious (it was that colour) into the crack of doom of shiny
porcelain urinals - Middle Earth was safe or so it
seemed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five hours later the race was to start, four hours of which
consisted of Steve refusing to leave the campsite until his bowels
moved. And move they did - a couple of times at the campsite
followed by a few more at transition. The battle of the bowels has
passed&nbsp;</p>

<p>Preparation was complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The veiling shadow that glowers in the East takes shape as the
battle of transitions continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Colin won the battle of T1 with a glorious time of 1.11 a full 5
seconds in front of Neil who just sneaked in front of Rob by one
second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>T2 was not so good for Colin who had gone over to the dark side
and ran down the wrong aisle, Steve was determined to gain back his
transition crown and put in an incredible 57 seconds a full two
seconds in front of Neil, this is attained by carrying your shoes
our of transition and putting them on past the timing mat, Colin
trailed out of transition some 27 later to rue his orienteering
skills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The swim was wet, the bike consisted of putting out a constant
400 watts, the run hurt.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[GE Great Britain Age-Group Team Manager, Peter Hallatt said: "I am really excited to be taking a decent sized GE Great Britain Age-Group Team to compete in the most iconic and arguably, the toughest duathlon."]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>There were more than a dozen GB age groupers and we forged a
pretty good team spirit. We met up for the race briefing and
enjoyed the pasta party together. Most of us warmed up together at
race start and spent the event giving each other high-fives plus
cheers of encouragement.</p>

<p>Great award ceremony and dinner on race night. British girl
narrowly beaten into second place in the professional category. A
few podium finishes for GB age groupers, including Coventry
triathlon legend Steve Howes (4 times Kona qualifier plus channel
swimming buddy with Steve Mac and Jamie Goodhead).</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
Very Scenic tough hilly run/bike/run 10k/150k/30k.<br />
This is THE Long Course Duathlon. Highly recommended. Terrific
organisation (imagine Challenge Roth without the swim or the flat
bits). As difficult as running/cycling Ditchling Beacon constantly
for 8 hours or so.</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong><br />
Easy 1 hour train journey from Zurich airpost. My hotel in Old Town
Zofingen was 5 mins walk from train station and 5 mins walk from
race start. Beautiful cobbled streets and pretty Swiss buildings
like in a fairy story.Didn't have to cycle on the cobbled streets,
fortunately.</p>

<p><strong>Race</strong><br />
Gorgeous cycle up and down big hills with cows grazing beside
Alpine Chalets. Some challenging sharp turns 30+mph but well
marshalled and no traffic to speak of. Some flat-out TT aero
sections for good measure. Insanely steep for running. Walked up
and sprinted down every hill. Lots of people burned out running up
the hills and were spent by the end, but I kept to HR zones and
finished nice and strong.</p>

<p>Finished about 20-30 mins quicker than I predicted and came 6th
in my ITU Age Group category. If I had been 3 months older, I would
have taken bronze!!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong><br />
I am delighted with my 8:06 and being top GBR athlete in my
category on the day.<br />
However, if Loz Wintergold had not pulled out with a knee injury
then he would have finished some way in front no doubt.</p>

<p><br />
See video clip<br />

http://www.videoportal.sf.tv/video?id=adab32e3-97e9-414e-950b-4ff87ac19784</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The male professional winner's speech got a bit awkward when he
revealed the depth of his rivalry with the third place man. Throws
darts at a picture of his rival to motivate in training. Read out a
spiteful Tweet where the third place man falsely accused him of
doping. The organisers cut his speech short when the world number
one duathlete revealed he was learning to swim and intended
competing in triathlon.</p>

<p>Lucy Gossage won silver as she represented the GE Great Britain
Team at the prestigious Zofingen ITU Powerman Long Distance
Duathlon World Championships in Switzerland&nbsp; <a
href="https://www.britishtriathlon.org/news/silver-success-for-gossage-at-european-championships_2259">
https://www.britishtriathlon.org/news/silver-success-for-gossage-at-european-championships_2259</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Gossage said: "I'm very pleased to finish second on what is
definitely the hardest course I have raced. I was certainly not
prepared for the true brutality of the runs! Eva had an incredible
race and thoroughly deserved the win. I'm sure I'll go back one day
now that I know what to expect!"<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The men's race was won by Joerie Vansteelant of Belgium. Britain's
Matt Moorhouse was 21st in a time of 7:47.26.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The GE Great Britain Age-Group Team celebrated more medals with
Dominic Rohan-Gates (M25-29) and Nikalas Cook (M35-39) winning gold
and Steven Howes (M50-54) adding a silver medal.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[5:30am in a hotel in Coventry !!!!]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>5:30am - Race day starts at a hotel in Coventry where my
first&nbsp;concious&nbsp;effort is to down the pint of sports drink
placed next to the bed, closely followed by two hob-nob cereal bars
(chocolate covered), a banana, and more fluid. It's the breakfast
of champions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6:00am - I'm on the road getting increasingly nervous (and
tetchy) but somehow navigate my way safely to the venue where it
all starts to go quite badly wrong. I get out the car and promptly
turn my ankle on a large lump in the ground, then to help me get
over it the valve on my front wheel shears off as I put the pump on
it - to put it in context, it is now 6:55am, race brief is in
15mins, and my wave has to be in the water in 25mins - my kit is
not yet in transition, and my water bottles still need
filling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much swearing ensues and my (long suffering) wife sorts out the
water bottles and my race belt whilst I flap big style and change
the front inner tube. 7:06am - wheel changed but I am flapping even
more as I think I pinched the inner tune when I put the tyre back
on - It is pumped up and appears sound but I still flap like a good
'un. I dare not check the pressure on the back wheel - it was 110
last night - that will have to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>7:10am I get my kit into transition and roughly laid out. A
quick sprint to the race briefing where I use the
time&nbsp;profitably&nbsp;to get into my wetsuit and pray I heard
all the important bits. I race back to transition to check the
layout of my kit and do some last minute prep. I look at my watch
and it is saying 7:25am - I should be in the water now!!!!! A quick
sprint and I am at the water where I literally have enough time to
let some water into the front of my suit and we are into the
30second countdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The horn goes and we're off. I reckon it's 350m before I&nbsp;
man up and deal with the cold water&nbsp;on my face, but from then
on all I can think about is whether I pinched the inner tube and am
I going back to a flat front tyre. My mind is nothing if not
focused! I try to practice all my drills to be hydrodynamic, and
exit the water in 31mins - a PB (thank you Mark). Up the hill to
transition pulling off my wetsuit as I go, at the bike my drills
are a little slow but and I exit without further mishap.</p>

<p>I quickly get passed by one guy on a swanky looking bike, but he
applies the brakes going down a hill shortly afterwards (pussy) so
I pile on the gears and fly past him. Onwards we go and I quickly
start passing the faster swimmers. I know I am pushing hard as my
legs are feeling the burn after 5 miles, but I am having a great
time hunting down those in front of me.</p>

<p>Into my second loop it starts to rain, but as anyone who has
been cycling this summer will know - it is just part of your Sunday
morning ride. I am now a little worried about the run as the course
is primarily on grass and it could be a little slippery, but I am
on a flying lap and stop worrying too much.&nbsp;All the marshals
are awesome and manage the traffic to allow the bikes to exit
junctions without danger - I shout my thanks to as many as I
can.</p>

<p>Back into transition, where my wife (and fellow triathlon
widows) are cheering hard. I look at my watch and realise I have
done 40km in about 1:07 - ANOTHER PB!!! My goal for the whole event
was sub 2:45:00 and I am well ahead of that target. Good drills
follow and I am out and running
(slight&nbsp;embellishment&nbsp;there - more of a fast shoe
shuffle) on the four laps of a flat (Ha!!) course. What they failed
to mention was the 50ft tall berm you have to climb/descend on each
lap, but like a good boy I keep running (unlike some).</p>

<p>By the time I get to the final lap, I have been needing the loo
for some time (drank too much lake water), and when the kidney pain
sets in I debate the pros and cons of peeing on the run or darting
behind a container - decency prevails and I lose 45seconds and
600mls - a quick dash to the finish and it is all over: 2:31:29.
It's not every day you take 38mins off your PB and finish in the
top half of the field (just)!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My post stretch reward is copious amounts of fluid and a bacon
buttie -&nbsp;nutritionally dubious but well received
nevertheless.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lots of lessons learnt about prior preparation and planning -
but all in all a very successful day out.&nbsp;</p>

Alden and Mark Jordan are going to try to complete the journey in 9
days - indeed they have to because Dave Ricketts is booked to
perform surgery on the 10th day and has his flight booked from Wick
to Gatwick.</p>

<p>LEJOG might be a common and well trodden path but it will be
&nbsp;real challenge to the five. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The planned route is to pedal just under 100 miles each day.
Amazingly, Emma Alden is driving the support wagon for the entire
journey; what a star!!!! &nbsp;</p>

<p>They are raising money for Help for Heroes andy have set up a
website for <a href="http://www.bmycharity.com/FOFdoLEJOG2012"
target="_blank">sponsorship/donations click here</a></p>

<p>There will be a daily&nbsp;post&nbsp;on this club website to
keep you informed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I should have the route up here soon so you could pop out and
join in for a day.</p>

<p>What a fantastic time I had, could not have enjoyed it anymore.
Having all those familiar and friendly faces on the start line
definitely made it more of a social fun run.</p>

<p>13 miles seem to fly past, maybe it was the continual talking!
dancing at the water stops or just the wine!! whatever it was I was
disappointed when we got to the finish.</p>

<p>Mile 2&nbsp;&nbsp; First taste of white wine, Trevor's eyes lit
up at all the Power Gels and started to fill his pockets.</p>

<p>Mile 6&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought a queue for the toilets and welcome
sponges, supplied by an old gentleman having the time of his life,
sponging down all the ladies!!</p>

<p>Mile 10&nbsp; Brought extra wine tasting - a water fight with me
and Kay - Two courgettes! carried by Trevor and Jules (have you
cooked them yet?) and a lovely picture of Claire skipping off into
the distance.</p>

<p>Mile 13&nbsp; MSTC competitiveness kicked in and there was a
dash for the finish or it just could have been the tea, coffee,
cake, fruit, Bar b q and more wine supplied at the end, so we
greedily put back all the calories we had lost.</p>

<p>Bring it on again next year:)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Trev's
Report</strong></span><br />
I'd just like to mention the pumpkins ... I was first competitor
over the line carrying a pumpkin!</p>

<p>I also managed to eat more crisps , pretzels and jelly babies
than anyone! And despite a valiant attempt from Jim I won the
competition to earn the entry fee back by collecting as many gels
as possible , even managing to store some inside Roses sports bra
!</p>

<p>Also the MSTC medics at mile 12 ... Steve pumping that poor
woman full of gels until she vomited!</p>

<p>And it was Roses first half marathon!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span
style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JulesReport</strong></span><br />
The "courgettes" are actually the size of small pumpkins rather
than the sort you find in Sainsbury's!</p>

<p>Definitely the most fun I have ever, and I'm sure will ever,
have on a half marathon. I echo Jean's sentiments when I actually
got quite sad At mile 9 when I realised there were only 3 miles
left!</p>

<p>I think the quantity of wine increased each stop due to
realising that there were fewer and fewer people following us
:-D</p>

Sunny 'Skippy' Sunday<br />
I went to bed on Saturday night and slept soundly. On Sunday it was
a perfect day, I left with my printed out map of the bike route to
get to Denbies and met Jean on route.</p>

<p>Cycling to an event has to be the way to go, no problems with
nerves. The route was great and Jean and I enjoyed the bike ride so
much, it was more of a concern that my map reading skills - while
cycling - would get us there (which they did). It was a beautiful
scenic route and didn't feel like the 30 miles at all. We got to
see the Olympic rings on the heights of Box Hill as we made our
final road towards the Vinyard.</p>

<p>On arrival at Denbies, which was so lush-green and beautiful we
were surrounded by runners dressed up to the nines! I liked the
runners dressed up as vineyard grapes - by the time the run was
done their balloons as had deflated with the heat of the sun
pounding down on them and every so often a few would bang as the
balloons burst with all the friction created.</p>

<p>It was Such a relief to be back in the swing of things, again.
It really didnt feel like 13 miles. I was pretty certain that post
injury that I would run 4 and walk the rest. I ran and skipped a
very decent 12 plus miles. Meeting up with Fiona, Jo, Sharon,
Graeme, Steve, Kay, Jim, Helen, Juls and of course Trevor and Rose
was superb.</p>

<p>We had an enormous amount of fun, we chatted, danced and stopped
of course at every feed-drink station to make sure that we were
hydrated, re grouped and then we all ran on again. I did quite a
lot of skipping ... I found that too much sugar does make for a
very skippidy hoppidy me - thank goodness I didnt have any wine
!</p>

<p>This event was really well organised, lovely marshalls and a
really good event to be part of - sometimes running for fun,
chatting with friends and enjoying the scenic view has to be a
founditory reason for all the training that is done in the year.
They provided a great post BBQ, music and the atmosphere was
fantastic. I would definitely do this again, be more organised and
dress up and would cycle back next time too.</p>

A great day for a PW (personal worst finish time).<br />
Brilliant fun race with fancy dressing, wine, sunshine, friends and
great scenery.<br />
Felt like it was the South of France running beside vinyards in
blazing heat.<br />
Had the rare privelage to run with (and chat to) the race leader
(eventual winner) for a couple of miles. Jonathan Ratcliffe had
lapped me and I had no trouble keeping up with him for a while
seeing as his legs were 13 miles more tired than mine. Jonathan is
a 2:45 marathoner and won this event in 3:11, which shows how tough
the course was with hills and half-drunk half-marathoners to
negotiate.<br />
Not for the first time, my competitive wife sprinted past me on the
finish and beat me by a couple of seconds.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sharons
Report</strong></span></p>

<p>Best half marathon I have ever done &amp; best of all I achieved
a PW (Personal Worse) - also the first time I have ever finished a
run feeling a little bit tipsy (lightweight - I obviously don't get
out much).</p>

<p>I've just checked the pics on the website &amp; it's the first
time I'm smiling while running - he! He! The scenery was fantastic
and it was great to just stroll up the hills exercising the jaws
from all the chatting</p>

<p>Also needs to be said on the race report that Steve was
"chicked" at the finish post by at least a second - lol xx<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Steve's

<p>What a great race and my kind of nutrition plan more wine than
you can drink and more jelly babies than you can eat a great social
run except for the last 5 meters when the girls got a bit
competitive :) think this will have to be a club run for next
year.</p>

<p><strong>LeJog Day 1&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Land's End to Okehampton 100.04 miles 6h28m58s average speed
15.51mph.</p>

<p>We started just after 8.30 after the obligatory photos at Land's
End. Ian had bought a new bike at 12 days notice when his original
Ribble bike (actually hewn from solid rock) had finally died and
was deemed beyond repair. He was therefore making adjustments right
to the last second. As we started he realised the saddle wasn't
right and he had left his glasses behind, so our first pitstop was
after less than a mile to get him sorted. The other problem was
that he has always used Campag group sets, and the new bike was
Shimano which is sufficiently different to cause trouble until he
got used to it. So the very first significant hill after 6 miles
required a gear that he just couldn't find, the chain came off and
jammed and we had another lengthy pit stop!! Remarkably another lad
(also riding LeJog) had a chain problem at exactly the same place
at the same time so a large group of cyclists were hanging around
the roadside.</p>

<p>The only rule we had made before setting off was that everyone
should get new tyres to reduce the risk of unnecessary punctures.
So guess what? Yes - the only old tyre in the whole group had the
only puncture of the day. Mark got it changed quite quickly but it
happened on the most exposed part of Bodmin Moor with a howling
crosswind so by the time we got going we absolutely freezing.</p>

<p>In spite of taking the most direct route along the A30 it was
still a very hilly ride. The 4 mile long hill as we approached
Okehampton was expected but still tough. The steepest climb of the
day was a mini Cobb Lane in the final half mile to our night stop
at the Youth Hostel. At the top we realised we had done 99.6 miles
so we cycled round the car park several times to make it 100 miles
before we stopped.<br />
Sad - or what?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>LeJog&nbsp; Day 2</strong></p>

<p>Okehampton to Burnham on sea 77.50m 5h7m44s average
15.11mph<br />
<br />
Total so far 177.53m<br />
<br />
There is a cast list at the end of this report so you know who I am
talking about.<br />
<br />
Day 2 started much brighter than yesterday. The sun was shining and
everyone was up in time for an early breakfast sorted for us by the
Saint. It turned out that the Tour of Britain was finishing in
Okehampton today so there were many cyclists at the Youth Hostel,
but there were also road closures in place which fortunately didn't
affect us.<br />
<br />
Today we kept off the major roads and were rewarded with generally
low traffic levels. There was one kamikaze tractor driver who
managed a 90 degree left turn into a field at speed while the Ox
was trying to draft him on the way to Crediton. Minor roads does of
course mean monster hills, and today's special was Cadbury Hill on
the way to Tiverton - 3 miles long with a similar incline to Kidds
Hill made it quite special, but having a vintage car tour going the
opposite way was quite spectacular. There were about 30 or so pre
war motors, and most of the drivers gave us a cheery wave. I
distinctly heard a young passenger in an old car shout something
about old gits on new bikes though.<br />
<br />
We stopped in Tiverton town centre for a bite to eat, and received
our 3rd spontaneous public donation to the charity ( that is £12 so
far). We then took a detour to visit Churchill's sister to find the
Saint already there. We were treated to another tea break as well
as a delightful ride along the narrow Devon back roads which also
included encouragement from the local youngsters. Single track
roads with steep descents and climbs to match were about as far
away from yesterday's riding as it was possible to get. Only Cling
On struggled and came down the hills with his brakes glowing red
hot!<br />
<br />
We then had a faster ride on into Taunton then Bridgewater where we
planned another break. Before we got there though, Brace had
another puncture, and we then had the comical scenario of 5 men
changing an inner tube. Unfortunately Brace's pump was not suited
to the type of valve he had, and after fully pumping it up, twice
it released the valve insert and lost all the air. Luckily we had
spare pumps and we eventually got it fixed.<br />
<br />
After our tea break in Bridgewater, The Wobbler confidently shot
off in completely the wrong direction, eventually realising he was
heading for Minehead and not Bristol. Once on the correct route
though we managed to reach Burnham on Sea for our next stop.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Cast List</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Ian Anderson</strong> - now known as 'the Ox' - for his
formidable power over any terrain and in any circumstances.<br />
<br />
<strong>David Ricketts</strong> - after tenaciously sticking to the
back end all day yesterday - now known as 'Cling On' Cling On clung
on as only a cling on can!<br />
<br />
<strong>Brad Williams</strong> - needs no introduction as he is the
legendary 'Wobbler' and has already lived up to his
reputation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Mark Jordan</strong> - now known as 'The Brace' after
hobbling everywhere the day before the ride with a purpose made
knee brace pretending to be injured before wiping the floor with us
on his bike. Whilst riding if you hear the command 'Brace! Brace! '
it means that Mark has another puncture!<br />
<br />
<strong>Emma Alden</strong> - now known as 'The Saint' for her
amazing efforts behind the scenes, driving the van, making sure
everyone has a proper breakfast, loading and unloading and
generally being completely fantastic!<br />
<br />
<strong>Steve Alden</strong> - now known as 'Churchill' - because
of his natural leadership and organisational skills. NO - it is
because he nods his head when he rides - just like the dog on the
insurance advert - Oh Yes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Le Jog Day 3</strong><br />
Burnham&nbsp; on Sea to Leominster&nbsp; 100.55 miles 6h22m57s
15.75mph average.</p>

<p>Total so far 278.08m</p>

<p>We stayed at a great B&amp;B which meant a late start as we had
to have the full breakfast but it was well worth it. We headed off
via Bristol at quite a good pace - only slowed down by 2 huge hills
which seemed to go on forever. The first view in Bristol was the
magnificent sight of the Clifton suspension bridge over the gorge.
We eventually cycled underneath it before heading around the city
to the old Severn Bridge which had a cycle path to cross the
Severn. Unfortunately we came across literally hundreds of people
who were also crossing by the same path. However they appeared to
be dressed as dalmation dogs. On closer inspection it turned out
they were actually meant to be cows. They were all on a sponsored
walk for a local hospice but the connection to cows was never
explained!! Because they were going the same way we had to slowly
weave our way through dozens of small groups whilst also contending
with the powerful cross winds. Cling on clung on to one of the
groups by mistake and there was an anxious wait at the other end
before he finally emerged unscathed!</p>

<p>We had now crossed our first international border successfully.
Only the Wobbler was concerned about the visa requirements for
entry to Wales but luckily there was nobody in customs to check and
we got in safely.</p>

<p>The Welsh had been warned that we were coming and had resurfaced
the entire road network which made a very pleasant change from what
we were used to. The road from Chepstow to our lunch stop in
Monmouth was delightful following the Wye valley and passing
Tintern Abbey.</p>

<p>We met Andy Lennox and his charming wife Helen in Monmouth and
put away huge numbers of calories. Of course Churchill could not
resist commenting on seeing his desert 'Look at my Spotted
Dick'</p>

<p>The final run via Hereford and Leominster was all up and down
with the Ox leading the charge up most of the hills including one
monster hill. Brace worked hard to keep Cling On going until we
finally neared our destination when he started riding like a Cling
On posessed.</p>

<p>They all asked Churchill 'Have we done 100 miles'</p>

<p>Oh Yes!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Day 4</strong></p>

<p>Ludlow to Runcorn 86.47m 5h21m27s 16.14mph average&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total so far 364.55m&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had a really good meal in plush surroundings last night in
Ludlow and also sampled the delights of Butty Back beer, a Wye
Valley speciality! It certainly got the Ox thinking so he turned
out this morning with his Ann Summer's bib shorts that were
completely see through. It was like following a bike rack! I have
heard stories about the Ox and the Ass, but not the Ox's ass, and
none of us will be able to sample 'Oxtail' soup without
remembering! Having a crack at the front has taken on a whole new
meaning and in the interests of transparency the story has been
told in full!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brace really struggled with his knee all morning today and was
in a lot of pain, being forced to virtually 'one legged pedal' to
get by. Fortunately it settled later in the day but it has been
quite worrying. By contrast Cling On shot off like a scalded Cling
On and almost had to be restrained until he ran out of steam before
lunch by which time he was clinging on!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is always good to see some great views as you cycle. As we
approached Shrewsbury the Ox pointed out the hill range named after
him The 'Quantox' ( Quantocks). The Wobbler had a near miss when he
was so dazzled by the appearance of the Ox in front of him that he
almost didn't react to a pothole in the road. However it was he who
had to shout Brace! Brace! to announce the only puncture of the
day, which he changed in record time.</p>

<p>The team spent a happy few miles counting Churchill's 'bob
count' and the record was 141 in a minute. They were all very
pleased though, with his route today as it was gently rolling for
the most part, and some great views in the Delamere Forest. All was
well until we approached Runcorn, which appears to be a series of
major roads joined&nbsp; together by other big roads, and we really
felt we were taking our lives in our hands as we switched from one
dual carriageway to another. We got there in the end, to a fine
hotel under the flight path, next to a railway station in the
middle of a motorway network, to be greeted by the Saint, who yet
again had checked us all in, organised food, got everyone's bags
out and has been completely saintly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have we had a good crack today?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh Yes!!!</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I arrived on the Saturday afternoon to register having travelled
for nearly 5hrs and when i looked at THAT lake i said to myself "
why the hell are you doing this again" !!! Maybe they will cancel
the swim and&nbsp;turn it into a duathlon!&nbsp; I stopped moaning
to myself [something you do when you get older!] and went and found
my B &amp; B.</p>

<p>After a very fitful night's sleep i had a bowl of porridge and
cycled down to the race start at about 08.00. On arrival in
transition i looked out at the "lake" and it was like a mill pond,
not a ripple in sight!! No wind, blue sky and reasonably warm. I
thought this looks good!!!</p>

<p>By the time the first wave set off at 09.30 the sky had begun to
cloud over and the wind had picked up a little and the water was no
longer FLAT!! Well by the time my wave, the last, went off the wind
was whipping down through the valley and the water was covered in
"white horses" and it was really choppy. Within 100m the wind got
worse and the waves got bigger!! I thought if i swallow enough
water i might just empty the lake and run round the course!!! I
continued to struggle through the water and eventually i could see
the exit pontoon but the nightmare is not over yet as the last 15
or so metres is so shallow you almost have to crawl as you can't
stand and walk because it's really rocky!</p>

<p>With a helping hand i was&nbsp;up onto the pontoon and running
into&nbsp;T1 which went without too much trouble.&nbsp;Although it
was cloudy&nbsp;it was fairly warm, unlike last year, so i didn't
need a long sleeve top on for the ride and i was soon out&nbsp;onto
the out and back undulating&nbsp;bike course on closed
roads.&nbsp;The first&nbsp;half was into a strong head wind, so it
was difficult to get a good&nbsp;speed going but i did manage to
overtake a few riders. The return section, although undulating, was
a lot faster, so i was soon heading back&nbsp;towards T2.</p>

<p>This transition went without a hitch and i began the run, which
is an out and back undulating course on pavements. Although the
wind was bad&nbsp;the run went very well and i even managed
negative splits. By the time&nbsp;i crossed the finish line the
wind was howling and the sky had really darkened but i did manage
to&nbsp;return to my B&amp;B before it rained!!</p>

<p>"We'll be at the Severn Crossing for coffee and cakes at 11am"
they said - I foolishly thought they were still working on BST.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:10pm they finally rolled across the bridge claiming strong
winds and steep hills, by which time I was already heading towards
the lunch rendezvous thinking I had missed them. A quick scout of
the pubs in Monmouth brought me to the conclusion that Google
recommendations are rubbish, and I quickly changed the
venue.&nbsp;If you are contemplating doing LEJOG yourself - I can
now highly recommend stopping for lunch at the Robin Hood Pub in
Monmouth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boys rolled into town at 1:45pm with Emma arriving
simultaneously in the support wagon, and with the bikes stowed
safely in the beer garden, there were instant demands for full fat
coke; crisps; and directions to the nearest little boys room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An almost universal vote for steak and ale pie was followed by
more coke and sticky toffee pudding (albeit with a loud request for
a spotted dick from Steve). All this fuel was washed down with
stories of near misses with taxi cabs and high speed tours around
the car park in order to take yesterdays daily mileage from
99.6miles to 100. New nicknames have now been endowed on each of
them, with Emma being regarded by all as "the Saint".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The goal of John'o'Groats draws them ever onwards, and
discussion was had as to whether it would be acceptable to fill the
very last water bottles with beer so the party could start early on
the final day.&nbsp;Once they were suitably&nbsp;fuelled,
photographed, and restocked with Snickers bars, we sent them on the
way for the final 40miles of the day.&nbsp;It was great to meet up
with them all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three days in and they are doing well, demonstrating once again
that there is nothing a well trained club member cannot do,
providing there is a promise of alcoholic oblivion at the end of
the journey.</p>

<p>I'm not sure at any point prior to waking up in race morning,
had it actually sunk in what I was about to do, either that or I
had selectively blocked it from my mind.</p>

<p>We arrived in Wales on Thursday to register and just have a
chance to get used to the strange bed/surroundings etc.</p>

<p>Friday we drove the bike course. Well. I learned from that that
the westerly loop was easier than most hills we have around us, but
the 2nd loop was going to be hell on earth. The westerly loops was
quite good road, little bump hills that didn't take a huge amount
of effort to get up and at least 3 spectacular views. In contrast
the other loop was quite a stones surface with lots of winding
hedge enclosed roads and 3 of the worst hills I have ever
seen.&nbsp; The hill coming up into Narberth started off steep but
then eased off a bit but went on forever, the 2nd on the way into
Saundersfoot was a 16% straight up Jon, not dissimilar to Kidds
Hill and the 3rd, known locally as Heartbreak Hill was of similar
percentage but it did a lot of winding. Realisation also dawned
that the hill out of Tenby that I had said "oh no, I hope we aren't
cycling up here!" about, was in fact the hill we were running
up.</p>

<p class="Body1">Saturday, bike racking day. Took everything down,
racked it in my allocated slot and put the cover on, at which point
it completely disappeared! I've never seen anything like it, 1500
bikes all racked together in exactly the same place. It was at this
point I became quite thankful for the knowledge that I would be far
from the first person put the swim so that would make my life a lot
easier! &nbsp;After racking my plastic bags and driving off I
suddenly got struck with an immense paranoia that I had somehow
forgotten to put my helmet in my bag, even though I knew it had
been on my head at the point I racked the bag and wasn't when I
left!</p>

<p>Sunday. Race day. 3 alarms went off at 4 just to ensure that
none of them spontaneously failed and I woke to have missed race
start. 5:10 start making our way over to suddenly realise that I
had left the carrier bag with all my drinks in in our room, glad I
left early! Upon arrival, Darren dropped me off so that he could go
and park the car somewhere and I made my way to transition, still
not entirely aware of the magnitude of the situation, to put all my
bits on my bike.</p>

<p>Walking down the road to transition (it was still dark at this
point) was like a scene from a zombie film, and I thought wow, it's
actually happening,&nbsp;the start of a zombie apocalypse! But no,
it was just all my fellow competitors slowly walking towards their
destiny. Some neoprene clad, others not. Once I'd sorted the bike
and got my wetsuit on and everyone else was assembled we started
the walk down to the beach. I couldn't stop thinking to myself how
far it was and how I was one of the only people I could see wearing
flip flops rather than trainers!</p>

<p>As we were nearing the beach it was still dark and I was
beginning to wonder if tinted goggles were a bad choice and which
point the chap next to me said he was thinking the same thing. Once
we had racked our bags on the railings of the ridiculous ramp from
the beach to the esplanade we made our way down onto the sand. We
were talked through the course which was 2 laps out to one what I
thought was a massive buoy, along the back to another,&nbsp;then
back in to the beach. The sea was perfectly calm which was nice,
seeing as the previous year had caught the tail end of that
hurricane, and the sun was just starting to rise behind the
clouds.</p>

<p>This is it, no backing out now. I need a pee. It's still dark,
where am I going again? Some of the thoughts that went through my
mind, then following a rendition of the welsh national anthem we
were off. This was it. Sink or swim literally.</p>

<p>Was the little amount of training I had done been enough? I
hoped so, I seemed to be able to pull it out the bag in the past,
hopefully it would work again this time? Hope so, there's a
lot&nbsp;riding on it, not to mention the bits I'd bought at the
expo which I would feel unable to wear if I failed!</p>

<p>I decided to hang near the back like usual, let the pros fight
it out among themselves. Right, pull pull breathe, pull pull
breathe, this is easy, just think of it as the Arun swim that
you've done so many times before... Heading out to the first buoy
was quite hard going, for a start, despite the thing being about
7-8 feet tall and similarly as wide I just couldn't pick it out, I
think it was the plethora or orange lifeboats around that detracted
from it... An, there it is, pull pull breath, woohoo I'm there,
next! The back straight was fast. That ws probably the quickest
side by far but again as the buoy ws even further away this time it
was even more difficult to spot so I hoped whoever was leading the
back knew where they were going as I'm pretty sure everyone was
just following them! After that one, back into the beach sighting
on Goskar Rock which is a bike spiky rock that is just off the
beach and is somewhat imposing. Go Iron Cops! Said one of the
banners that had been strung on it, yeah, go iron cops!&nbsp;you
can do it! Running across the beach I stole a glance at my watch,
40 minutes, not bad, just got to do it again. Getting back in
almost seemed harder as you felt like "but I've done this already!"
but do it again you must, so off we go. The sea had started to get
a little choppier at this stage. Still nothing too bad though. Out
of the water for the final time, I managed to get straight up with
no wobbling at all and made for the ramp. Found my stuff, got my
wetsuit off and rinsed myself down with water. Once at the top of
the ramp, donned my flip flops and jogged back to the transition
with a few people commenting on the fact I was running in flip
flops! But that's what I do!</p>

<p>Nothing really of note happened in transition although I did
note that I was in and out a lot quicker than some of the people
that had been in there before me.</p>

<p>Bike. This is the part I was anxious about since so much could
happen that is beyond your control. Quick time check, right I have
8 hours 55 mins to complete it. I can do this. I decided that after
the drive on Friday, the best course of action was to do the first
loop as fast as I could without compromising energy levels etc to
build myself a buffer for the harder loops, so off I went and I
actually felt like I was positively flying. I decided to treat it
like any other normal Sunday bike ride and break it up into things
I knew. The first loop I decided was out to Boxhill and back.
Amazingly I didn't even feel like I had done a swim at all and
basically felt fresh as a daisy. Legs turning well, past a couple
of cleat errors on the first big hill but they seemed ok, come on,
grind it up there then you'll be rewarded with a nice downhill.
Weeeeeeeeeeeeee! I'm liking this, with it being closed road you
literally felt like you owned the road, I think this was pretty
much every cyclists dream, go as fast as you like with no risk of
being hit by cars whilst dodging pot holes etc. I was living the
dream! Ok bike, we can do this, just you, me and the open road. If
you get me through this I'll buy you some new shoes (tyres) that
match your outfit and you'll look really pretty, I'm sorry I didn't
get you new shoes before the race, but we all know you shouldn't
try out new shoes on race day! And it seemed to work as we were
flying round passing various people with mechanical issues on their
fancy carbon fiber TT bikes.</p>

<p>The view over the bay that was so spectacular on Friday was less
so today, the wind was right up and I was being blown all over the
place! Thankfully that stretch is quite small before you started
cycling up between some sandy dunes. Made it round the bottom loop,
only 2 more to go. The first half of the 2 loop section is fine, if
you're ok riding round Sussex then it's nothing new, rubbish road
surface, tight turns and the odd bump in the road and incidentally
it seems like the primary road kill in Wales is slugs. Heading
towards Narberth there were a couple of really long grindy hills
then there was the hill into Narberth itself. I could see a couple
of people pushing their bikes up ahead but I thought I had to at
least try. After the initial ramp it was actually ok, got to the
top and it was like the top of a mountain at the TDF there was
music, hundreds of people and you could help but grin like an
idiot.</p>

<p>Round the whole thing actually the support was fantastic, people
all outside their houses cheering you on, I don't think I stopped
smiling at all on the first lap round. Then came some hairy
descents that I certainly was glad we weren't having to go up
before hitting the bottom of the 16% hill. I can only describe it
as the top section of Kidds Hill but a little longer. It just goes
straight up and the road surface was a little rubbish which didn't
help. Managed to puff and blow my way to the top though then after
a bit of respite came Heartbreak Hill. Unsure of the % of this one,
but it was quite twisty and was again lined with people so stopping
wasn't an option then once all the strength in your legs has been
taken by those 2 hills you have to do a bit more climbing before
finally hitting the descent into Tenby... Before doing it all
again! Nothing much different to note about the 2nd loop apart from
the fact a head wind had got up and it started raining which pushed
away all but the most die hard of supporters so I think my grin may
have started slipping that time round! Especially when it got to
those 2 hills but with an additional 30 odd miles on your legs
since you last did them!</p>

<p>On the final descent into Tenby I had a little cry of happiness
as I realised that I was actually going to do it, there was no
reason at all now why I couldn't finish. I felt worn but not
exhausted or anything, it was actually going to happen, I was going
to go home an Ironman!</p>

<p>Got out onto the run pretty quickly and surprisingly my legs
actually felt fine, but what wasn't playing ball was my back. That
felt stiff as a board and just didn't want to loosen. The run
course was 4 loops up a horrible hill then back down and around
Tenby itself. Each loops you got a different coloured band so all I
could do was look at everyone else bands and decide how far ahead
of me they were or whether I was ahead of them etc. first loops
went ok. I stuck to my plan of power walking up hills and running
back down and it was going well. The support in Tenby was
absolutely fantastic with people shouting your name as you went
past, again, you couldn't stop the smiles!</p>

<p>By the 2nd loop my stomach was starting to feel really tight,
probably as a result of gulping too much air down with my drinks so
that wasn't helping the cause, but I was still sticking to the
plan, walk up, run down. By the 3rd loop when a lot of people had
finished and again the crowds had started dwindling it was starting
to get really really tough. I think it was also the hardest because
you were sort of in no mans land, you still had to do another loop
but you were so so tired and didn't have the motivation that came
from being on the home straight.</p>

<p>By the 4th loop I had perked up a little knowing that as soon as
I got that beautiful beautiful pink band on my arm that was it, I
could finish so I dug deep and ran where I could. I kept telling
myself that if i could finish before 23:00 then i would have a 15
something time. Unsurprisingly the only real support now came from
some hard core supporters in their gardens/hanging out of windows
"come in Sussex!" was the regular cheer I got and it kept making me
smile, I made sure I thanked all of them for their support on the
last leg as it really was that that gets you through with any hint
of a smile by the end.</p>

<p>Back in Tenby the support came from several groups of people
gathered outside pubs with their cowbells and high fives and it
just felt amazing, the final smile was when I ran past a restaurant
and everyone started cheering saying things like "yeah she made it,
go on Sussex!" and stuff like that. How many more corners 'til the
finish line? Surely I must be nearly there?! Then there it was left
for finish, right to go out on the loop again.</p>

<p>I'll take left thank you very much! I wanted to finish strong so
I took a hundred meters or so to walk jut to ensure I had enough to
power through the finish, then this was it! I'd done it! The moment
I'd spent a year preparing(well sort of) for and it was all going
to be done in the next 10 seconds! Better still I was going to get
15 something.... Epic!</p>

<p>Once through the line (15:39:26) I got given my medal by the
mayor who must have been standing there all day bless him, and a
big hug from one of the helpers who said she'd been cheering me on
from the swim and was really really pleased for me.</p>

<p>One of the little things that made me smile is they give you the
timing chip band which as you can imagine over the last 36 or so (I
put it on the minute they gave it to me to avoid losing it!) hours,
I had become rather fond of.</p>

<p class="Body1">Now, sitting here typing this it's all a bit
surreal. I know I did it because I have the medal, t-shirt and very
very tired feet, but apart from that I don't feel substantially
worse than after just an ordinary marathon. Maybe there is a pain
saturation point after which it literally can't get any worse?
Would I do it again?</p>

<p class="Body1">Yes, definitely! I'd say to anyone out there, if
you want to do one, just do it. If you are determined enough then
it will happen. Don't allow self doubt to stand in the way, it
really is an incredible feeling that everyone should get to
experience.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5</strong></p>

<p>Runcorn to Kendal 82.61 m. 5h49m14s. Average speed
14.15mph&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total so far 447.16m&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was great last night meeting up with Fiona B. who has been
working here for the last 2 months. She was happy to show us the
giant chimney stack where she works, on our way to Frodsham for an
excellent meal. This morning's breakfast however was not so good
because the hotel did not get their milk delivery. That didn't
affect Churchill or the Saint who missed breakfast altogether but
the others had to make do with what they could get.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everybody was a bit jaded today. The aches and pains were
beginning to catch up with us. Both Brace and the Wobbler now have
sore knees, whereas for Churchill and Cling On it is easier to list
what doesn't hurt!! It was not hilly today but the wind had turned.
The majority of the day was spent riding into a headwind. It was
much colder than usual and intermittently there was driving rain.
It was much safer getting out of Runcorn than getting in and we
soon crossed the Mersey and on through the very busy areas of
Widnes, St. Helen's and Ormskirk before heading towards Preston. We
cycled through Preston in torrential rain but our Landlady this
evening says it is not much better in bright sunshine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Churchill was so tired today that when he was cycling along a
cycle lane he was totally unaware of his surroundings, and had a
near miss with a cyclist coming the other way. They had been
approaching each other for at least half a mile but he failed to
notice him at all. They missed each other by inches! Did he get
away with it - Oh Yes!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a good to see Lancaster which seems a really nice city,
before we crossed into Cumbria and headed towards the lake
district. We were still generally at a low ebb, partly because we
had been told we had much further to ride than we really did - they
just do not put mile markers around here. In desperation Cling On
asked at a petrol station and found out that we only had 12 miles
to go (about 10 less than we thought) - as we left Brace shouted to
the attendant 'I think I love you'&nbsp; but received a very
bemused response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We then saw the River Kent and followed it as it gently wound
it's way into Kendal. Churchill led them directly to their B&amp;B
where we were met by Yvonne, a bubbly German lady who insisted she
would have been called Brunhilda except for a quirk of
fate!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kendal is a delightful town, and we have just had steaks all
round with 3 bottles of wine and desserts for about £60 -
astonishing prices once you start getting further north.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are looking forward to getting into Scotland but
there is the small matter of the Lake District hills to contend
with first.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are now about half way!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Day 6.</strong></p>

<p>Kendal to Thornhill 96.72m 6h50m44s&nbsp; 14.13mph
average&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total so far 543.88m&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Wobbler has been room sharing with Brace and today he let us
all know what it was like having a Sikorsky helicopter in his room
- not that Brace's snoring was affecting anyone else. Ox's snoring
however has been described by Cling On as like an epileptic
hippo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing we cannot generally complain about so far is the
weather - and today has been no exception. We awoke to bright
sunshine and although it didn't last all day it did least stay fine
until we were out of the Lake District. We had one of the monster
climbs over Shap Fell and Ox had a mechanical problem halfway. The
others had to wait for 10 minutes at the top and got very cold in
spite of the sunshine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the bottom on the other side we stopped in Penrith at a
Sainsbury's cafe. Brace hobbled across the store which was huge.
When he arrived back his knee was quite swollen from his effort. He
had walked across the store to find a toilet and came back to find
it was in the cafe all the time!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next town was Carlisle which took forever to traverse
because we got caught by just about every traffic light. We had a
plan to get to Gretna by back roads but it was difficult to find so
the Wobbler stopped at a motel to ask. After some trouble we worked
out where to go and the receptionist's face lit up when the Wobbler
said we had been staying in their motels along the route -
travelodge. Unfortunately we were standing in the reception of a
Premier Inn!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We crossed into Scotland and then headed West to Dumfries - into
a howling cold head wind until we finally reached our destination
of Thornhill and a welcoming coaching Inn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Were we pleased to see it - Oh Yes!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Day 7</strong></p>

<p>Thornhill to Dumbarton 83.9m 6h2m37s 13.89mph average</p>

<p>Total so far 627.78m</p>

<p>WET, WET, WET!!!&nbsp; is the only way to describe today.
Torrential rain all day - until it got really wet! I have been
drier swimming in my wetsuit!!</p>

<p>It all started quite positively with the Wobbler getting
everybody going with his deadlines to departure then a photo shoot
with the Saint (with us sheltering under the tailgate of the
van).</p>

<p>The first 20 miles followed the Nith valley which is beautiful
even in the rain. It didn't take long to reach our lunch stop in
Kilmarnock, but we were already getting a bit cold. We had to cross
some verges to get onto the road after checking some directions. I
have never seen anyone bunny hop over a foot high railing before. I
still haven't!! Ox McQueen tried and failed and ended up in a heap
on the grass!! At least he wasn't badly hurt.</p>

<p>We piled into Asda for a bite to eat and basically just dripped
everywhere. At least we warmed up a bit after fish and chips all
round, and at that moment the Saint appeared with the offer of dry
clothes. Cling On and Ox had been riding with shorts and at least
Cling On took the chance to dress more warmly and more dry layers
were added by several of us. Yet again generous members of the
public gave us spontaneous donations to our charity (Help for
Heroes).</p>

<p>The afternoon was tricky for lots of reasons - not only was it
wet, windy and cold but we were heading for the Erskine Bridge to
cross the Clyde. We wanted to avoid going too far into Glasgow
itself so we went a scenic route which was harder to find as many
junctions were not signposted. This slowed us down so we became
wetter and colder still. We finally reached the Bridge when we
realised that Lord 'Cling On' Lucan had disappeared. Wobbler and
Brace went back to look for him and we had just got the Saint out
to help look for him (while Churchill and Ox were sheltering from
the rain in a garden centre) when he finally appeared. He had 2
punctures, but with the rain and traffic noise, nobody heard his
shout and only realised a little way down the road.</p>

<p>Once we were back together we were freezing cold and shivering
and our combined brains had completely turned to mush with the
result that we tried to cross the bridge on the main carriageway to
the great annoyance of all the drivers. Once the tailback was about
a mile (Half way across) we had to carry our bikes over the crash
barriers and onto the cycle path (which was officially closed -
hence our mistake). It was a lot safer on the path.</p>

<p>With light failing we finally reached our B&amp;B, to find they
had a problem with the hot water. Churchill and Cling On ended up
with cold showers but at least we were out of the rain. Luckily the
limpers (Brace and the Wobbler) managed to sort out their water and
later it was available for all!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Were we happy to finish today? Oh Yes!!</p>

What a difference a day makes!!<br />
<br />
Today we had virtually wall to wall sunshine although being so far
north it has been quite cold. We were delayed at the start when
Churchill realised he had a puncture. Further investigation
revealed not one but two Dumbarton thorns had pierced right through
the tyre. The first one was easy to spot but Brace's finger found
the other!<br />
<br />
Dumbarton is just on the West side of Glasgow, but is only a short
distance from Loch Lomond. In bright sunshine the two hour ride
along the lakeside road was amazing. We had to stop for a photo
call to capture the scenery. Ox took a picture on Wobbler's<br />
camera and he had to ask how to change the camera angle. 'Move the
camera'&nbsp; came the reply!!<br />
<br />
Once we left Loch Lomond we started the climb into the Highlands -
for over 5 miles, fortunately interrupted by a stop at the
Crianlarich Hotel for a snack as there were no towns for the next
36 miles.<br />
Luckily Saint stopped to join us and we were able to put on extra
layers as in spite of the sun it really was very cold. We then
carried on to the top, where the scenery was truly breathtaking,
with high mountains all around, small lakes dotted about and the
road rolling ahead of us. There was one more big climb near the ski
area before the drop into Glencoe and some of the views here were
stunning. The descent was fast and furious, and even Cling On got
wind&nbsp; burn<br />
with his brakes glowing - at one point he thinks he may have hit
16<br />
mph!<br />
<br />
We stopped for tea and cakes in a tea shop in Glencoe village
before<br />
crossing the Loch and heading for Fort William, with Wobbler
setting a very strong pace and the group functioning as an
effective peloton. The last 10 miles to Spean Bridge was rolling
with one final climb past the commando memorial to our
B&amp;B.<br />
<br />
By mutual agreement, yesterday must have been one of the worst ever
days cycling for any of us, but was today one of the very
best?</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">Oh Yes!!</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Day 9</strong></p>

<p>Spean Bridge to Tain 86.34m 5h29m16s 15.73mph&nbsp;
average<br />
<br />
Total so far<br />
815.3m<br />
<br />
Last night's B&amp;B was the best accommodation yet. Our hosts kept
shaggy, horned highland cattle which were totally friendly and
happy to eat toast! The location was just North of Fort William
under the shadow of Ben Nevis, so stunning scenery as well.<br />
<br />
We awoke this morning to a thick blanket of mist as we were quite
close to Loch Lochy. It was also very cold, about 4 degrees. We set
off suitably wrapped up and by the time we rode through Fort
Augustus the sun was shining. We then followed the West bank of
Loch Ness, keeping our eyes peeled for signs of any strange beasts.
Local reports did<br />
suggest 5 strange beasts, but this has not been confirmed. The road
here is surprisingly undulating so was quite challenging.<br />
<br />
After a morning tea stop in Drumnadrochit we elected to go cross
country to avoid going through Inverness. Here we found the one
true monster of the day - the climb out of town. It had an average
gradient of 15 % and was about a mile long but with the cumulative
fatigue it was a really tough test. Some sections were very steep
but we all got up - even the Ox had to use his granny ring but
stayed seated whilst everyone else was standing on the pedals
(except Brace who managed it even without a granny ring). The real
reason Ox remained in the saddle was that he was hoping no-one
would notice his bib shorts. He was wearing his special Ann Summers
bib shorts again, but rightly decided to wear a second pair on top.
The problem was that these were on inside out!! At least this way
he got an extra days use out of them!<br />
<br />
Once North of Inverness we had arranged a tea stop with some Help
for Heroes supporters, close to the Cromarty Bridge. As we
approached the Bridge we were cycling as a fast peloton, as one in
perfect harmony. Everyone knew where the meeting point was and
Brace was pushing hard at the front. Unfortunately he completely
ignored the signs and bunting that had been put out for us and shot
round the roundabout to go over the Bridge, closely<br />
followed by Wobbler, whilst Churchill and Ox could only look on in
dismay as they went the opposite way. Cling On came to the rescue
and just managed to stop them going over the bridge and back to
Inverness.<br />
<br />
Tea and buns had been laid on for us and several local cyclists
also met us there - they all seem to have done Le Jog at some stage
so they really understood what we were doing.<br />
After the very welcome tea we cycled the last 20 miles to Tain like
an express train, alongside the Cromarty Firth led by the Ox.<br />
<br />
So we now just have one day to go!!</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Tain to John o' Groats 89m 6h7m15s 14.54mph average</p>

<p>Total 904.3m</p>

<p>Our final day dawned bright and sunny. Quite remarkable because
we knew that big storms were due for this area from the next day.
The route north followed the dramatic eastern coastline but with a
variable wind and undulating road it was not an easy day. We all
knew that for the second day running there would be one evil climb
somewhere in the middle. 'Watch out after Helmsdale' was the
warning......&nbsp;</p>

<p>We stopped in Helmsdale for a brief coffee, as there were very
few places open on a Sunday and then the fun started. The first
skirmish was a steady 5% climb out of town for half a mile,
followed by a brief flattening out. Then came what we thought was
the main event with a 10% climb for about 2 miles, but it was a
steady climb which we took in our stride. Churchill commented how
he felt cheated out of a proper climb but was soon to rue those
words. One mile later there was a dramatic descent with a 90 degree
bend at the bottom, immediately followed by a hairpin bend with a
13% climb on the other side. This was about a mile long - and was
much like going up Kidd's Hill, in length and difficulty, but the
real problem was how strength sapping it was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After this the road was undulating and quite windy until we
changed direction for the last few miles into Wick. Then we had a
tailwind and were really shifting. We stopped at Tesco for a quick
meal (we had long found that supermarkets on the outskirts of towns
give you a quick decent meal at a sensible price) and were ready
for the final stretch, 16 miles to John o' Groats. By this stage
Churchill was beginning to suffer and anything remotely uphill was
becoming a challenge. Everyone pulled together and we finally
reached the outskirts of town and stopped for a photo at the town
sign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final mile down to the harbour will long live in the memory.
The realisation that we had reached the end was just amazing. The
Saint was waiting for us and went ahead to film the final
arrival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From my perspective I feel this has been one of the hardest
challenges in my life but it was made achievable by having the
company of 4 super companions and the support of the Saint without
whom the whole thing would have been so much worse. We have laughed
so much over the last 10 days you would not believe.. In spite of
our West Coast drenching we were remarkably lucky with the weather.
Bad weather throughout would have been purgatroid - a new word
coined by Saint but it sounds right!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p><strong>Ox (Ian Anderson)</strong> - super strong throughout,
may need some new bib shorts !</p>

<p><strong>Brace (Mark Jordan)</strong>- creaking bottom bracket,
creaking right knee, (one of the 'limpers')&nbsp; but never wavered
and stayed very strong.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wobbler (Brad Williams)</strong> - creaky knees (the
other limper) but always prepared to laugh from his belly ( you
have to see the video when we can get it uploaded!!)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cling On (David Ricketts)</strong>&nbsp;- chuffed to
bits to have finished and always maintained his steady pace. Will
dine out on this achievement for many years to come!</p>

<p><strong>Saint (Emma Alden)&nbsp;</strong> - what can I say -
indispensable!! Did so much behind the scenes to make the ride a
pleasure for the rest of us. Thank you so much from all of
us.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Churchill (Steve Alden)&nbsp;</strong> - Totally
knackered!! But is he still bobbing his head ?&nbsp; OH YES!!!!</p>

<p>This ever popular hilly road race had 1,319 finishers. The
impressive African winner, Yared Hogos, finished in 1:06:53 (a
couple of minutes outside the course record).&nbsp;</p>

<p>A decent showing of 10 MSTC members produced some good
performances and PB's in near perfect conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a nice chat with Rachel, Lucy, Emma, Mike and Helen before
the race. However, I did not manage to meet up with Steve, James,
Hazel and Martin at all. Helen was the only one I managed to spot
coming over the finish line with a stunning sub-2 hour run that was
10 mins better than her previous best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residual fitness from ironman training earlier this season
allowed me to take 4 mins off my 2011 Barns Green effort to get a
very pleasing PB. Funny how months of training/racing at HR 140bpm
allows one to get PB's racing at HR 170+bpm. Thought I'd managed my
first ever podium finish for this 3rd in age-group result, only to
find this race only gives awards for 1st and 2nd in
age-group!&nbsp;</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>This race is billed as a challenging self-navigated off road run
from London to Brighton, facts which I am not sure I really
understood when I entered. The more people I spoke to, the more
horror stories I heard about checkpoints being abandoned and bags
just left at the end, and the more concerned I became.</p>

<p>The fact that the map book only arrived 3 weeks before the race
was not terribly helpful either, especially since I had begun to
recce the course as per previous years and there had been
significant changes.&nbsp; In fact I was more worried about getting
lost than running the distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, I did manage to run the course south of the M25 in bits
and pieces prior to race day, which calmed my nerves
somewhat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Race day was a 6am start in Blackheath with registration in a TA
hanger full of fit looking people and the discussions of previous
races began.&nbsp; It is pretty difficult not to doubt yourself
when surrounded by multistage desert racers and people using the
race as training for the 400 mile Arctic Yukon race, but too late
to back out now..&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have to say the run was scenic, even through London.&nbsp; The
course ran through Lewisham, Bromley and to the west of Biggin
Hill, crossing the M25 just north of Limpsfield Chart, then east of
Edenbridge and East Grinstead.&nbsp; The run then goes via Wych
Cross to Horsted Keynes and then through Chailey Common heading
south to cross the Downs at Black Cap, then through Falmer to
Brighton.</p>

<p>The 5 checkpoints were well stocked with water, bananas and in
the latter stages cakes, biscuits and also cold roast salted
potatoes dipped in tomato sauce which have to be one of the most
delicious things known to mankind when running this
distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I managed to go off course 3 times (once was in Ashurstwood
which is a part of the course I had run in training) but nothing
too terminal, adding 1 or 2 km at the most and was never running
alone.&nbsp; The people were friendly and happy to chat as we ran
which was encouraging and also useful as many of them had a great
deal of ultradistance running experience.&nbsp; I did meet 2 other
people who were also doing their first ultra and both finished just
ahead of me.&nbsp; I was pretty amazed at the number of experienced
runners who were happy not to look at their maps and just follow
inexperienced people like me, especially when I was joined by Rob
and Jamie, acting as tour guides for the latter stages of the
run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the run went pretty much as expected for me.&nbsp; I
was comfortable until about 35 miles and then began to tighten up
as we climbed from Weir Wood reservoir and it was then that Rob and
Jamie's support was invaluable.&nbsp; Rob ran with me for about 15
miles from mile 31 and Jamie joined us in Horsted Keynes at about
mile 40 and ran to the finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I enjoyed the day, despite the pain.&nbsp; Interestingly I
learnt that it is possible to run through pain and out the other
side to a stage where running is actually more comfortable than
walking (although up hills are still very difficult after 50 miles
with weak legs).&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised that, even when
we were within a mile or so of our house, I was not tempted to
crawl into bed with a cup of tea!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The low point was leaving checkpoint 5 knowing that I had the
walk up Black Cap ahead, but thehigh pointwas reaching the top with
Jamie and seeing not only the sea, but also Steve and Kay, which
was a real boost.&nbsp; I knew then I could get to the finish and
promptly ran past 3 other runners, one of whom tagged onto Jamie
and I and then finished with me.&nbsp; He was a French guy called
Sebastian and a mutual thumbs up was our signal to each other of a
job well done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I look back I am not sure I would do it again, although as my
legs recover I could change my mind..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>All I know is that I could not have done this without all the
encouragement from everyone I know.&nbsp; It is fantastic to belong
to a club where people don't tell you that you're mad when you
suggest something like this.&nbsp; Claire Cresswell deserves
special mention for getting me to start running on the Downs and
Rob for training and company on the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will be forever grateful to my amazing husband Jamie for
putting up with my training and for his help on the day.&nbsp; Not
only did he run about 20 miles with me, he kept my spirits up and
force fed me jelly snakes on a regular basis to keep me
going.&nbsp; He always knows just what I need and that is just one
of the reasons I love him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I competed in my second ever triathlon on Sunday morning, in
conditions that were more conducive to spending the day in bed than
partaking of a multi sport event. A view confirmed by the current
Mrs John!</p>

<p>The alarms sounded early, but we were prepared(egg sarmies,
coffee, etc.,) and we loaded up the kids and headed to the seaside.
As we passed the Amex community stadium, I realised that there was
no horizon, as the grey mass of the oceans joined hands with the
grey fingers of the rain. At least the temp was in +. We arrived,
decanted the various bags and "kuthundu" required, before being
asked to drive the car up to the top of the car park so as to have
"something " to watch!<br />
<br />
Eventually found the transition zone, after expecting to find it
closer to the water. Racked my bike, donned my wetsuit, and readied
my belongings for transitions. And then it started to spit. So I
covered everything with my bag, only for it to roll off my shoes
and display my clean smalls to the gathered audience! Quick
briefing and a surprise visit from my sibling!<br />
<br />
So we embarked to the start of the swim, me trying to herd a
chattering of kids and uncles, only to realise that they were about
to start the race! Water was indifferent, but at the very least it
was not freezing. As a result of my faffing, I swam 1040m! Pull
pull breathe, and the added salt buoyancy got me out in just over
18mins, despite the two run ins with kayaks( turn around now sir,
and , watch out for the quay!) and some entirely unneeded comments
about sturdy ladders for sturdy athletes. Long t1 (wet feet, wet
socks, bag again!) and off out on the bike!<br />
<br />
After the first zip along the coast road, I regretted not wasting
another 30sec not putting on a jacket. Not because of the chill,
but more to do with the needling rain. Turned left at St dunstans
and into ovingdean. So far, so good no hills. How I hate hills.
Drag myself up one, telling myself that the down hill will make up
for the pain. Only to brown short it due to the wet roads. Up, up,
up and away to woodingdean, and the singular most vile bit of road
ever attacked by yours truly. Recovery roll across the top of the
downs, one small rise to cope with and then the glory of the
sweeping accelerating decent back into Brighton. And then do it
again!!!<br />
<br />
Repeat last paragraph!<br />
<br />
Rolled back down to t2, and realised there were still bikes out
behind me. :-) change of shoes, cries of cant feel my feet, can't
feel my ears popping around as I managed to ejaculate Iso gel all
over my hands. Nice!!<br />
<br />
Out onto the run, and realise that the cliffs offer a lot more
respite from the wind. Lots of "serious" athletes returning from
the run leg, and some compatriots in the slow lanes overtaking each
other provided some entertainment. " keep going mid Sussex, you are
looking good " did boost my stride. Thank you. The feeling of
exquisite agony on turning around, realising that I've done this
once, I can do it again. No more overtaking, lots of smiling and
then finished! Yay!<br />
<br />
Swim. 1000m. 18.04<br />
T1. 7.44<br />
Bike 32km. (90.). 80.12<br />
T2. 3.48<br />
Run. 8km. 46.40<br />
<br />
Total. 2:36:18<br />
<br />
Lets do it again!!!</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>11 MSTC athletes took part this time. This year the race was
brought forward by a month from it's traditional time at the end of
October. Slightly warmer weather and a later than usual start made
it quite a civilised race but as usual superbly well organised and
marshalled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The men certainly surpassed all expectations. Jim, Mike, Martin
and Gordon all gained new PBs. Jim was really flying with 1h22m33s
while Mike ran his first time under 90mins with 1h28m6s. Martin
started very strongly and finished in 1h36m58s and Gordon cruised
round with his dad for most of the way (just leaving him towards
the end) for a 1h48m04s. I think we are going to see further huge
improvements from both Martin and Gordon in the next couple of
years.&nbsp; Steve A managed a respectable time (1h32m23s) just 6
days after completing LEJOG and James paced himself round sensibly
to a sub 90 minute time (1h29m28s)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lucy (1h43m4s) held off a very strong challenge from Emma Jaffe
(1h44m38s), with Rachel not far behind both(1h46m10s). Hazel was a
bit disappointed to find it quite a struggle this time in
1h51m19sand Helen Graham comfortably completed it sub 2 hours
(1h57m06s)&nbsp;</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>My trek up to Chester started on Saturday, leaving behind the
family of wife and 4 year and almost 2year old kids.&nbsp; At least
the marathon guaranteed a good night's sleep but perhaps running a
marathon is not the only way to achieve this!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year had been all about this marathon with my only other
race events two 10k runs and a half marathon, virtually no cycling
or swimming.&nbsp; The year before had been a similar affair with
three marathons Brighton (3hrs 24 and too hot), Beachy Head (4:09:
too off-road and hilly) and Portsmouth (3:34 - too cold and unfit).
I was really concerned that getting close to my pb of 3.10 (set at
Rome in 2006) was a lost cause. But I figured I 'd give it another
go. So all the eggs had been placed in the basket a long time ago
and I was hoping to crack sub-3 hour into the equation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early start as usual - with the upside of having kids is that
waking at 6am without interrupted sleep meant that I was feeling
the most refreshed I'd been in a long time. Small bowl of porridge
and a banana 3 hours before race start then it was off to Chester
Racecourse for the start. The organisers had a lot right - warm
tents to hang around in - check. Excellent baggage drop - check.
Lots of portaloos - no check (luckily that side of things was
already sorted).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Race start was on the Chester Racecourse itself and literally
entailed ducking under the white metal rail onto the horse racing
course.&nbsp; It felt a bit strange to be at the front - after the
marathon fails last year was I really even wise to step into the
sub-3 area with others? But I figured that there is no use
predetermining the outcome by being conservative and choosing a
slower time. &nbsp;And knew I should be there or thereabouts after
a 1:25 half marathon the month before. &nbsp;So with the elite
thoroughbreds at the front, and the club runners around me I was
banking on not being the pantomime horse in my bit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The town crier got us started with an oh-yay and a horn and we
did a half lap of the racecourse on the grass (fortunately they
don't start a marathon in Aintree!). The course then weaved around
Chester city centre past the famous clock tower, the cathedral and
the tiered olde worlde shops called the Rows. Soon we were out of
the Chester part of the marathon.&nbsp; In reality the majority of
the course was on rural roads held across the border in Wales.</p>

<p>I settled into a group regularly doing sub-6.30 to 6.40 times
and figured that this would be the one to hang onto. The first half
of the course was fairly flat with some gentle undulations but
nothing noticeable when feeling fresh.&nbsp; I was happy with the
pace, but dropped off this group eventually towards the halfway
point as the main people doing the work in the bunch suddenly
dropped their pace.&nbsp; I was through the half marathon point
exactly at 1.28.&nbsp; Slightly ahead of pace and only 2 ½ minutes
off my half pb.</p>

<p>The next section of the race was when the going started to get
tough however and the course became more undulating.&nbsp; I was
holding the pace at the right speed (6.50 for sub-3), but it was
really tough going as the field was much sparser by now.&nbsp; Some
nice if sporadic support along the very rural route and Wallace and
Gromit music in a village was great.&nbsp; There was a couple of
hills along this point that were absolute killers (not in terms of
normal running) but when trying to stay on pace (not possible) and
to get back onto my average pace after they finished they were real
mental challenges.&nbsp; Eventually I passed the 20 mile point
seemingly at 2.15 (new pb for this distance). I now had 45 minutes
for 6.2 miles to get sub 3. But unfortunately the course and my
body had other ideas.&nbsp; A succession of uphill drags meant that
I was losing on average 30 seconds per mile and my body was giving
the early warnings of cramp.&nbsp; The mind games were now in full
swing - every time I started thinking negative I tried to keep it
within the moment - just keep pushing on and ignore everything
else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Normally I get a bit of adrenaline at the end of a marathon and
my pace picks up again, but the threat of cramp became real as my
hamstring went for a full blown lock out that stopped me in my
tracks. I didn't hang around to stretch it out however and carried
on a downhill section breaking occasionally into the monty python
ministry of silly runs onto the final riverside section, which led
into the Racecourse.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the bridge I thought
signalled the entry to the stadium was another ½ mile away but I
continued on at some sort of pace.&nbsp; Finally the course came
into sight and it was back onto the grass race course for a final
push to get under the 3.03 mark.&nbsp; Final official chip time was
3.02.50, nearly 8 minutes of my time from six years ago. And some
proof that I haven't peaked yet! On the plus side, it will also
allow me to qualify for the Boston Marathon either for 2013 or
2014, which is another tick on my bucket list!!!&nbsp;
Unfortunately, not quite sub 3 and 2 minutes 50 secs is also just
too near to the sub-3 that I now have to try for it again.grrrrr!
&nbsp;Overall, I was very pleased with the time but with a sense of
unfinished business.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For those interested in my training
schedule:</strong></p>

<p>Started training consciously 8 months ahead of the race.&nbsp;
Longest weeks were no more than a maximum of 50 miles in total,
which I built up to gradually over the 8 months.&nbsp; My longest
run was a misjudged 23 miler but other than that my longest runs
were 20 miles. Each week I did a maximum of 4 runs but many weeks
only 3 runs per week.&nbsp; This often included a long run (12
miles building to 20 miles as the weeks progressed), regular hilly
tempo run off-road - 8 miles, faster short run (6 miles with some
extended intervals), occasionally a 10 mile run or a treadmill
session but each week was judged according to niggles, workload,
family commitments etc. Part of my training was entering races,
which were essential as gauges of being on track plus a nice
intermediate goal along the way.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning my footwear, as I used my Inov-8
F-lites, which are 195 gramme shoes.&nbsp; These are among the most
minimalist shoes out there and, compared to 'marathon' shoes I have
used in the past, I can honestly say that I feel no worse on the
day after than in any other shoes.&nbsp; Also, no blisters at all
or black toes. I have been running in fairly minimalist shoes over
shorter distances for years, so I think that I am now fully
conditioned for them, but it shows that they can really work at any
distance. It's about all about fitness, conditioning and technique
and not support shoes.</p>

<p>It was a misty chilly morning when two member of the elite Elvis
impersonators wing of the Mid Sussex Tri Club arrived at the
Hickstead showground to take on the Hickstead Gallop - Haywards
Heath Harriers cross country race.</p>

<p>It was dry but the ground was a trifle sticky as large groups of
club runners stretched and warmed up we watched on, striking
triathalete poses, gazing through our 1980's orange wraparound
sunglasses as we nursed our hangovers and curry guts.</p>

<p>The gun went off and I burst to the front - I was in the lead -
two seconds later I picked myself up, wiped the mud of my face and
rubbed the spike marks in my back, 'humm reminds one of a good
night out me thinks'.</p>

<p>Up the hill, down the hill, up the hill, through the mud.</p>

<p>Up the hill, down the hill, up the hill, through the mud.</p>

<p>Running backwards as more runners come by, I try to block with
chicken elbows but to no avail, they just keep coming. The coaching
books say start in a sensible position and run negative splits so
you can have the joy, excitement and psychological boost of running
past people. That's not for me I enjoy the extra pain of
demoralisation and the feeling of losing every time someone speeds
past wondering why I am wearing a wool shirt fashioned into a
running vest.</p>

<p>Up the hill, down the hill, up the hill, through the mud -
straight through the mud as other traversed the gate to avoid
getting their £100.00 plus trainers dirty. Fortunately I had Robs
£15.00 second hand cross country spikes on that he sold to me for
£20.00 so straight through the mud, past a few runners at every
gate and chicken wing to the next gate - absolutely brilliant
spikes are thoroughly recommended if you do any of these
events.</p>

<p>Still they come past - until the line came in to view, using my
spikes and absorbing the DNA left in them by Rob to give me the
power of a Spartan (fortunately with clothes on) I sprinted to the
finish and past a few shocked runners as I past them, only to
realise they were carrying on for their final lap.</p>

<p>The day was complete when I found a muddy old runners glove.</p>

<ul>
<li>Colin - 34:57</li>

<li>Dean - 42.32</li>
</ul>

<p>The Abingdon Marathon was first held in 1982 and 2012 marks the
race's 31st year since its inception.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a flat, fast, scenic marathon with not too many
runners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This race sells out within weeks. Mostly good standard club
runners looking for a PB, because it's such a good race and usually
ideal temperature in October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About 750 starters out of the 1,000 entrants. About 80 usually
go sub-3 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre
Race</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No idea how I would do on the day but weather seemed perfect. 10
degrees, light wind, cloudy. Some muddy puddles from recent rain.
In 2011, I trained diligently for marathons and Abingdon 2011
yielded 11mins off PB for 3:11:03. Done several marathons since
then and not gone faster. 2012 has been dominated by long distance
triathlon and long distance duathlon with no specific stand-alone
marathon preparation. Heartened by taking 3 mins off half-marathon
PB just 3 weeks before Abingdon 2012. A bit in awe of Kevin James'
3:02 marathon finish a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My
Race</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Figured I would go for sub-3 and see what happens. That meant a
decent warm up for 10 mins before the start, so I could post
sub-7min miles straight from the gun. Delighted to find I was doing
6:40-6:50 min miles with relative comfort for the first 6 miles but
then got a nasty pain develop in heel at the Achilles Tendon
insertion. At age 49, one does worry about Achilles Tendon rupture.
Contemplated dropping out but decided to keep going as it did seem
a genuine opportunity to fulfil the sub-3 dream.</p>

<p>Toughed it out and got to half way in 1:29:30. Completed mile-22
and was averaging around 6:45 per mile, which was comfortably
inside target. Hit some kind of wall thereafter and the next miles
were 7:00, 7:10, 7:29, despite really trying hard and almost
passing out.</p>

<p>Always manage to rally for that last mile, which was around 7:05
on this occasion. Then the last half mile was at 6:30 pace as I
sprinted screaming like a nutter to motivate myself. Yes, that's
26.45 miles in total rather than the 26.2 miles I had in mind. That
extra quarter of a mile probably took a 100seconds or so.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post
Race</span></strong></p>

<p>Great to see Anthony Bliss of Sussex Sports Photography. Posed
for a few pictures. Delighted with <strong>3:01:17</strong>.
According to Garmin I had done 26.2 miles in sub-3 but
unfortunately that doesn't count.</p>

<p>Great to give Kevin a bit of friendly competition and perhaps
the nudge he needs to go sub-3 next time.</p>

<p>My heel feels wrecked and will need serious rest from running
for a while. Massive limp day after the race. Thank goodness I have
swimming and cycling to do instead for a while.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Due to the fact Loz being very modest I thought I would publish one of his records here, he completed this and other amazing events but you will have to drag those stories out of him as he wont send me race reports..(did you notice the dig)]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>In October these Hounslow &amp; District Wheelers club records
have been smashed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Place to place records are a longstanding part of the British time
trial scene, the governing body the Road Records Association was
founded in 1888. However in recent years record attempts have been
rare - modern road conditions, particularly the huge number of
traffic lights, have made the task more difficult.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
In most peoples minds this difficulty has moved on to
impossibility, but occasionally some one exceptional turns up to
challenge conventional thinking, and the Hounslow and District has
Loz Wintergold to fill this role. Loz has had a long time trial
career which has been illuminated by some flashes of brilliance,
for example when he led the Hounslow to the 12 hour team
competition record in 1997. This year he has been concentrating on
triathlon and has been honoured by selection for the Great Britain
Veterans Team for next year's World Sprint Triathlon Championships
in Turkey.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Perhaps the work he has done for triathlon has had a beneficial
effect on his cycling performances:in September an impressive ride
of 253.5 miles in the Kent CA 12 hour in spite of serious
mechanical problems gave him fourth place in the event and
confirmed him as this year's Hounslow BAR champion. It also
encouraged him to pursue his long standing ambition to attempt some
place to place records, but it was clear that some 'warm up'
experience would be necessary before attempting a national
record.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are three levels of place to place records. At the top there
are the RRA national records-Land's End - John O'Groats is well
known, but there are many others: Land's End-London (12 hours 1
minute 37 secs), London-York (7.29.45) for example. At this level
the records are now very tough. The next level down are the RRA
regional records, for example London - Marlborough and back, which
is Loz's next target. Some of these records are&nbsp; old and
therefore not so unassailable as the national records. Below these
are club records: in the past when national level record activity
was more prominent&nbsp; most clubs had their own records, and the
Hounslow was no exception with Hounslow-Worthing and
Hounslow-Newbury.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Record breaking has often gone in phases- a record will lie
dormant, perhaps for decades and then some one realises that
because of the general increase in time trial speeds it is now
beatable and has a go. This then sparks interest among other riders
and a new phase begins. The Hounslow records were so antique
(Newbury 1937, Worthing 1946) that only this summer the racing
secretary had suggested, quite reasonably, that they should be
scrubbed from the books as obsolete and impossible under modern
traffic conditions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the along came Loz. With the racing season over and with the
weather conditions deteriorating rapidly he was in a hurry to
exploit his current good form before the winter set in. His
schedule would be: Worthing, Newbury then Marlborough - London,
which would, he hoped, give enough experience to tackle at least
one national record next year. It was necessary to move quickly and
the Worthing attempt was set up in a matter of hours, although this
created difficulties since none of us knew what we were doing. Our
method was basic: we would have one following car with a timekeeper
and an observer who would also deal with feeding and any necessary
mechanical support (e.g. punctures). Two problems rapidly appeared,
first that if the route has not been fully agreed (and it wasn't)
it would be easy for the car to get in front of the rider without
realising it had done so, and second, in traffic at either
end&nbsp; the rider was significantly faster than the car. On both
occasions the Houslow turn was covered by the observer arriving
independently and then joining the car, but the Worthing turn was a
disaster&nbsp; with the rider having to wait almost five minutes
(in heavy rain) for the timekeeper's car to arrive.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For the rides we followed the established practice of starting at a
convenient point along the route, turning at the nominal start
point (The Bell in Hounslow), going to the far turn(Worthing Pier,
Newbury Clock Tower) and returning to the actual start point.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;The existing Worthing record was 5.43.01 for the 109 miles,
very slow by modern time trial standards, but time trials never go
near places like central Hounslow. Starting from the car park at
the foot of Box Hill at 9.23 am (Tuesday 2nd October) and turning
at The Bell at&nbsp; 10.12, it was soon obvious that the old record
was being annihilated. Loz arrived in Worthing at 12.42and was back
at Box Hill by 2.16 pm, making a total time of 4 hours 53 minutes.
Unfortunately our amateurish time keeping did not allow for the
seconds to be accurately recorded.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Loz described his ride as follows: "There was little wind or
traffic before Esher, then riding up the Olympic TT course to
Hampton Court gave me a buzz. I had to deal with a road closure
near The Warren which involved bunny hopping over a pipe, but the
nearest I came to real difficulty was when the south west wind
strengthened after Dorking bringing squally rainstorms which numbed
my fingers - the rain was particularly heavy at the pier where I
had to wait for the timekeeper. Once northbound the wind was
beneficial, and climbing up to Findon I found it easy to maintain
20 mph, and my speedo showed 41.5 mph on the descent. The only
point where I was struggling was the climb at Kingsfold".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Newbury record was done on Sunday 14th October. Starting at
Paley Street (B3024) at 9 34 am, we went through Windsor and
Datchet before joining the A4&nbsp; at the Colnbrook by pass. After
turning at The Bell (10.24) we retraced, getting mixed up with a
charity ride in Windsor. It was a relief to get back to the A4 at
Twyford although here wind, traffic lights and three traction
engines leading long trails of cars all caused difficulties. There
are 28 sets of lights through Reading, and then a further 23 sets
between Thatcham and the Newbury turn making, for the two way trip,
102 sets of lights. Loz rode steadily "as if I had an extra 50
miles to do, which I will need for the Marlborough&nbsp; record".
He was back at Paley Street by 1.53 pm: the new record, now
expertly timed by Trevor Gilbert to include the seconds: 4.19.24
for the 96 miles.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
We felt this showed that the 1937 record (4.33.36) by a Mr. R. Hall
must have been a brilliant ride by the standards of the time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Loz's enthusiam is such that he intended to attack the London -
Marlborough record next Sunday ( 4th November), until it was
realised that the London Brighton Veteran Car run would make this
impossible. The plan now is to wait for next year.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[7 MSTC athletes took part in the Marathon.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>After last year's sub zero temperatures - it was going to be
interesting to see what difference milder conditions with recent
torrential rain would make. Well - it was wet!! It was also
windy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As usual the pre-race banter centred around the excuses. Loz and
myself pleaded lack of training for distance, Jamie had done loads
of distance but all at a slow pace. Martin Sanwell was doing his
first marathon so did not really know what to expect. Jules had her
usual approach, so virtually no training, and Jim Graham was taking
it easy pacing his wife Helen round as his heel injury was still
recovering after his amazing 3h 02m a couple of months
ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jamie set off at a good pace straight from the start, but found
his lack of pace training was causing pain in his overstretched
hamstrings, so after 8 miles he backed off, allowing myself and Loz
to move in front. Jamie is doing a 45 mile ultra marathon in a few
weeks and it was not worth risking any damage at this
point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we approached the halfway turn (it is an out and back course)
Loz was beginning to breathe quite heavily which turned out to be
caused by tummy problems. Luckily there were 'facilities' at the
turn point, but this was just the start of a torrid time for Loz
with several stops in the second half.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jim was pacing Helen round and Jules was running at her usual
sensible steady pace, although the course made it difficult to keep
the pace even. It is half cross country and half tarmac, with 2
sections each way on shingle beach. The cross country sections were
very wet, muddy and slippery. If Loz wasn't having a bad time
already the last thing he needed was to slip on a wet concrete sea
defence wall then skid off the edge. Unfortunately there was a big
drop to the beach below and he completed the race with a huge graze
down his leg.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The conditions took their toll of everyone - especially as
the way back was predominantly into a headwind, and the pace slowed
for all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Performance of the Day for me goes to Martin. 3h44m for a first
marathon is exceptional, and there is clearly a lot more to come. I
am sure he will break 3h30m soon. Helen's 4h13m was also
exceptionally strong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Martin and Loz pushed themselves so hard that they each went
beyond the 'empty' point. When they finished they were both so pale
that they really looked ill. It took an emergency dash to the
nearest MacDonald's to refill them with junk food before either
looked remotely human again!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well done to those that completed it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was the 12th of January, snowing and I was sitting in bed
with a cold. &nbsp;What better thing to do than pack your gear,
head to Wendover and run to London along with 300 other eccentrics
including your wife. &nbsp;45 miles of cross country bliss and a
day without children, could it get any better? &nbsp;Actually yes,
what other race starts with bacon rolls and a cup of tea? &nbsp;I'm
not sure I can remember being in a pub, teeming with such energy at
7:30 in the morning but then again if the night had been that good
I wouldn't have remembered!<br />
<br />
These days one can't take these things too seriously, so starting
at the very back of the field we ambled down Wendover high street
to the first style - now it takes some time for 300 people to cross
a style who all arrive at the same time. &nbsp;No worries, time to
stretch, have a chat and ponder how the water will get out of your
water proof shoes when they fill up from the top!<br />
<br />
It's always nice to spend time with your wife, enjoying the
countryside and the company of strangers with interesting stories
about how they don't have heating and are using this as preparation
for their run from Birmingham. &nbsp;Things didn't change much for
the next 25 miles, run a bit, wade through some mud, have a chat,
look at a map, wait at a stile and repeat. &nbsp;The weather did
improve and at checkpoint 1 I discovered the best cake ever made
which included some magical ingredients that I'm sure were designed
to uplift one's spirits - the world took on a 60's glow!<br />
<br />
Now there is nothing quite like a light Siberian breeze hitting you
in the face for a day which contributed to the downside of the race
when I failed to motivate Mrs G to go any further than the Marathon
distance, which left me to go it alone. &nbsp;A stubborn one that
Em but the look of grey disgust and inability to pose for the
photographer meant we had failed on our mission of quality time
together so I may as well punish myself a little! &nbsp;75grams of
carbs and 500ml of fluid per hour and the knowledge that if I get
through the 30 mile point I had enough jelly snakes to get me home,
not forgetting the joy of more cake at the next stop was plenty of
motivation.<br />
<br />
A Canal can be quite boring but not the Grand Union Canal, that has
a few house boats, the occasional BMXer, water, footpath, disposed
toilet, dead fish, misleading sign or two, tree, derelict property
&nbsp;and at least 2 Sainsburys - now that beats seeing nothing
swimming for the same amount of time any day! &nbsp;And then came
the finish, at just over 8 hrs I crossed the line and went to the
pub - beats a round of golf but not quite as good as an Ironman so
I'd give the experience 6/10 but 10/10 for value - Race T shirt,
medal, mysterious cake, gels, and 8 hrs of entertainment all for
the bargain price of £40 odd quid - now that is a deal and better
than anything I got in the post Christmas sales and it gave me an
excuse to miss the Swimming Club's T30!<br />
<br />

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Mat Record, Steve Mac & Jamie Goodhead take on a chilly challenge.

"My body felt like a stone standing on the side and when I jumped into the 1 degree water for my first race, I was genuinely shocked....."
]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>As one of the original team from Toting Bec's South London
Swimming Club who put the Cold Water Swimming Championship's on the
map in 2007, this event is an absolute must for me. &nbsp;I swam
every Sunday through the winters of 2002, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in the Lido
and still miss that great comradely and "sensation" when racing
there. &nbsp;Feeling the water's temperature fall slowly from
October to February is as much nerve racking as it is exhilarating,
but the times when it fell as low as 1 degree Centigrade are few
and far between. &nbsp;Sadly I never got the chance to break the
ice to swim at the Lido.<br />
<br />
So when I jumped into the 1 degree water for my first race, I was
genuinely shocked.....not just because I am not acclimatised like I
used to be, but I was also entering unknown cold territory. &nbsp;I
screamed with cold, my body tensed up......then the beeper started
and the race (30m freestyle) had begun. &nbsp;With my arms pumping
and legs doing a 6-beat kick, I was on my way. &nbsp;The water
ahead had amazing clarity, I could see no one close to me. &nbsp;I
had won but there was no time for hanging around. &nbsp;In one
fluid motion I touched the wall and leapt out of the pool. &nbsp;My
body felt like a stone standing on the side for 2 seconds before
the blood starting returning to my body, and that incredible
feeling started. &nbsp;The buzz is pretty post-coital in
nature.<br />
<br />
And this is the reason why cold water swimming is so addictive.
&nbsp;Yes, I am a fully paid up member of the Nutter Club (along
with lots of you reading this article) but a few of us get our
kicks from freezing waters. &nbsp;The beer tent, hog roast, hot
tubs, sauna and comradely all add to the experience. &nbsp;Oh, and
reaching two finals (freestyle and "head-up" breaststroke) also
help. &nbsp;What started in 2011 with five members of the Tri and
Swimming Clubs going up to London has turned into 10. &nbsp;Tim
Fraser from the swimming club scooped a gold and silver. &nbsp;Our
two relay teams acquitted themselves well and we all had a superb
day. &nbsp; Next time we might have to break the ice.........here's
hoping!</p>

<p><strong>Matt Record</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>"From outside looking in you cant understand it -from the
inside looking out you cant explain it."</em></p>

<p>It is said that with cold water plunges the non-initiated can
only stare and ask "why?" Well that's not really true I also was
asking myself that in the run up to the Cold water championships. I
was looking for any excuse to pull out but as I was not only
entered for the freestyle I also had the joy of the&nbsp;relays so
there was no way I could let my team mates down.&nbsp;With gritted
teeth and grim determination I accepted that it was inevitable and
actually started to look forward to it.</p>

<p>Ok that's a lie, the first time I did this event in 2011 I
looked forward to it as I did not know what to expect, this time I
knew exactly what was coming. The water temperature was somewhere
between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees depending on where it was measured the
distance was a width of the Tooting&nbsp;Bec lido (32-35m) in
just&nbsp;speedos goggles and a hat.</p>

<p>The journey there was good fun I travelled with Matt and
Jamie&nbsp;(we were also in the same relay team) &nbsp;we were also
accompanied by some of the Marlins. We managed to stay off the hip
flasks until nearly all the swimming was over, unfortunately Matt
downed my hot mulled wine after one swim final while he was waiting
for the next, I say unfortunately as he thought it was
hot&nbsp;Ribena until he finished his gulp and then coughing
spasam.</p>

<p>The rules state that you have to all drop into the water hold
onto the edge with shoulders under the water and wait for the count
down this felt like 5&nbsp;mins but in reality 5 -10 sec's then
off. There were some quality swimmers there who I think had the
advantage of not spending so long in the water. 600 individual
swims so it was quite a large meeting with some of the most
eccentric people you will ever meet.</p>

<p>Anyway a great day with some bone chilling painful swims, would
I do it again... Of course cant wait until 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Mac</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week has been interesting; challenges at work, sleepless
nights with children, a house without heating, a sick wife, a
couple of trips to the Dentist (what kind of individual would
become a Dentist anyway?) a few swim and run sessions that pushed
the limits (the heavy meals beforehand were a mistake).
&nbsp;Regardless, life is now thoroughly enjoyable as the National
Cold Water Swimming Championships are out of the way.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no justification as to why. &nbsp;There is no
need to jump into freezing (literally) water and swim about like a
loon, however 600 of this nations "finest" disagree. &nbsp;The
Eccentric Magnet that is Tooting Bec Lido was to put on a show -
they came from everywhere, all taking pride in a bond created over
sadomasochistic joy!<br />
<br />
I often think that with sport you are given a bottle of pain to
deal with as you see fit. &nbsp;Regardless of the competition, you
should have an empty bottle by the end; be it a 400m swim, 10mile
TT, Marathon, Ironman, Ultra, etc. &nbsp;Emptying the bottle in 20
odd seconds can be quite an eye opening experience, while using it
up through anxiety before you start inevitably ends in grief.
&nbsp;Having completely emptied the bottle, to find out the body
wants to continue with jaw grinding grief is "un-fun"!<br />
<br />
Like reaching blindly into your toiletry bag and feeling the sweet
sensation of your Mac 3 razor lacerating your fingers, so it was to
be, one race after the other until Jagermeister and Whiskey dulled
the sensations and nullified the singing of the local hula ladies
and their ode to the Lido. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I can't wait to do it again, it must be like
childbirth!<br />
<br />
<em>&nbsp;"Make pain your friend and you will never be
alone".</em><br />

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[I checked the list of entries to date, and there was the name of the guy who beat me by 6 seconds on my first race, and whom I beat by 2 seconds last time. Decision made - I had to race and beat him properly.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Wednesday evening found me looking at the BBC weather forecast
for Sunday, trying to decide whether to do the Castle Coombe Chilly
Duathlon as a season opener. The weather looked cold, dry, and
windy, but no rain was forecast in the meantime so that was good.
Then I checked the list of entries to date, and there was the name
of the guy who beat me by 6 seconds on my first race, and whom I
beat by 2 seconds last time. Decision made - I had to race and beat
him properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now I have nothing against the chap - I barely know him - but I
needed to get my season off to a good start, and beating a "rival"
seemed like a good idea. There were a couple of minor flaws in my
plan, including the fact I had not prepared specifically for the
race, the bike was still on the turbo trainer, I hadn't practiced
transitions since September, on-line entries were closed, the race
is four days away and I am not at home for three of them. Minor
details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saturday comes and I decided I had better get the bike ready and
do a quick run. The bike prep was fairly simple, and I even managed
to change the tyre without puncturing the inner tube (a rare
success). My run however had felt a bit slow and sluggish recently
so off I went to put in a quick couple of miles to prove I still
had it. A short while later (and a new mile PB to give me hope) I
felt ready - I had even managed to come up with the innovation of
using elastic bands to stop the icy cold wind whistling up my non
elasticated sleeves. Genius&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sunday morning comes with a civilised 10:30am registration. Bike
racked, multiple pit stops (too much hydration), race briefing, say
hello to the rival, and it's off to the start line. Off goes the
gun, and unlike last year I set off at my pace - not that of the
racing snakes near the front. Halfway through the first lap the
girl next to me started beeping and confirmed that we had reached
one mile in a respectable 7:10. My rival had dropped back at the
1km mark so I knew all was going well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Into T1 at 14:25 and what followed can only be described as a
case study in why you should practice your transition - I did not
and 1:25 later I finally emerged on my bike, Doh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five laps of Castle Coombe racetrack follow without incident,
but I was now frozen due to the 0 deg 13mph wind. Into the final
straight heading towards T2 and I managed to get my feet on top of
my shoes for a fast exit off the bike - that at least worked and we
quickly rack the bike and get the trainers back on. It rapidly
became apparent that I need to do more bike-run transitions as
"gazelle" was the antithesis of my running style at that
point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My wife was by the T2 exit and I shouted a query about my rival
- "he's right behind you, cane it" she yells - off I went like a
startled sloth. My wife's yell started to haunt me and I got my
legs going a bit faster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I noticed a few runners a couple of hundred yards ahead of me,
and having ignored the two runners zipping past, I realised that I
was actually catching them. At the 1.5mile mark I caught them, and
at a useful hairpin on the run course I looked back to see where my
rival was. He was nowhere to be seen and my wife was confirmed as
being a lying toe-rag who should not be trusted for race
advice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final half mile passed without drama and a quick sprint took
me to the finish line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Negative split on Run 2 v Run 1, all bike laps within 3 seconds
of each other, 87<sup>th</sup> overall compared to 164<sup>th</sup>
last year, a new PB of 58:25 for the race, and more importantly I
beat my rival by 6 minutes (!!!). Happy, happy days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My wife pleaded guilty to perverting the course of injustice,
and was sentenced to an afternoon of repeated second by second

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[This year's Duathlon was held in the Duathlon 'season' - which made a big difference to the attendance, but although it was nearly 2 months earlier than last year, the conditions were actually better.

Not that it was easy, we just managed to start without rain. After that it did get colder when it started raining and the wind picked up.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>In the end 9 hardy souls took part, 2 for the short course and 7
for the long. &nbsp;At the off, Phil Couch was initially quickest,
but Neil then reeled him in and went on to run 38.17 for the 10k,
which was very impressive as it was quite wet and slippery and
muddy in places. Jim Graham was next through in 40.56.</p>

<p>Phil was doing the short course as he is just getting fit again
and completed 5k in 19.24. Rachel and Lucy were running at the same
pace, but Lucy was doing 5k (23.26) and Rachel 10k (47.12).&nbsp;
It was great to see Jeff back racing again. 47.38 for 10k may have
been the slowest on the day, but is still a respectable stand alone
time for this sort of course.</p>

<p>The times will show that Jim had the fastest T1, but it was one
of the most bizarre transitions ever. He reached the mount point
still wearing his trainers then proceeded to change into his bike
shoes and dumping the trainers with Helen who was marshaling there.
Phil is the man to watch in T1, because he is so quick you might
miss him - very slick!<br />
John MacTear learnt from last year's error and got out of T1
without a hitch this time. Lucy took the most leisurely approach
but getting the right number of layers on for a cold bike leg was
the key to survival.</p>

<p>The bike course was modified from last year due to roadworks.
However it is much easier to navigate and nobody went wrong,
although the excellent marshaling form Helen, Gordon and Andy as
well as Sharon on the run course guaranteed it. Neil is clearly on
top form at the moment because sub 64 minutes on a cold wet and
windy day was awesome. Most&nbsp;people were slower than their
usual but the weather did get worse once the rain<br />
started and the wind picked up, especially on the return leg of the
lap. If you look at the results you will see that there were no bad
times - everyone did so well in the conditions.</p>

<p>T2 is always interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil again showed
what is possible, with an astonishing 20 second split. Ant looked
like he had a good T2, but not before he came in the out way, and
then had to go back out and round to the proper dismount at the car
park entrance. Luckily we weren't penalising anyone for transition
aberrations. Rob took both his transitions (and most of the race)
at a laid back pace, he always looked like he had loads left in the
tank.</p>

<p>Most people ran the last 5k at a slightly slower pace than the
first 10k, but Neil still managed sub 20 minutes and it was Rob
with the second fastest time in 21.30, although again no-one was
slow. Phil managed 10.15 for his last 2.5k for a very fast overall
performance in the sprint race, and Lucy again ran strongly with a
12.06 lap.</p>

<p>Prize for the most cheerful athlete must go to John for
insisting on enjoying himself all the way round whilst still making
a huge effort and racing extremely well.</p>

<p>Thank you again to all the marshals, Sharon Chladek, Helen
Graham, Gordon Skeats, Andy Jenkins and Hazel Tuppen. Everyone
appreciated all of your efforts and support. Special thanks go to
Hazel for bringing her homemade chocolate covered flapjacks - they
were absolutely delicious!!</p>

<p><br />
It was also nice to Mike and Emma Jaffe coming out of their way on
a long run to cheer everybody on.</p>

<p>After a very early wake up call of 04:30. yep 04:30 still full
of cold and then scraping the ice of the windscreen I set off to
Haywards Heath Triathlon.</p>

<p>The race as all Hedgehog races are very well organised and run
with out issue, except for the 04.30 wake up call.</p>

<p>First swimmers off at 06:30 it was a very cold start with some
athletes pulling out after and on the bike due to the cold, best in
these conditions to spend an extra few seconds putting on the
correct clothing as cycling fast down hill is cold even when you
are not soaked from the pool.</p>

<p>A great lumpy bike route from HH to Ansty down to Burgess hill
then up Issacs lane back to HH and repeat. The run ummm best do
some hill repeats to train for this as its up hill out of
transition then down hill back to transition 4 times.</p>

<p>The 4 loops were great as it meant you went through all the
crowds a few times, 4 in fact, which gave you the boost to attack
the hill again.</p>

<p>A great show for MSTC gathering a great haul of trophies and all
members coming in the top 6 of their age group:</p>

offer a set of FREE 'race conditioned' sessions to help you with
your training. There are absolutely no costs for these events.</p>

<p>2011 &amp; 2012 was a successful season for all involved with
the series and we would like to thank you all for being part of a
fantastic Journey. With many new strengths discovered, new limits
passed and new friends made it was a fantastic year that culminated

least one of the series, that way we can maintain a FREE Tri
series.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Many people consider this an iconic race, with its own special
challenges and history. Certainly it is one of the tougher races on
the official ironman circuit due to heat, winds and hills. Maybe it
is difficult for Brits to get ready to race in the heat so early in
the season, having trained in the cold. Lanzarote is a cycling and
triathlon paradise so some serious competitors spend time training
and acclimatising on the island for weeks before the
race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that, Lanzarote ironman is great fun and suitable
for all abilities. You can take it slowly because there is plenty
of time to finish. At the race briefing there were &nbsp;plenty of
people doing their first ironman and one person was doing their
first triathlon!&nbsp;</p>

<p>They let finishers go across the line with their kids, which a
lot of races do not allow. It was all pretty friendly and laid
back. Despite stern warnings at the race briefing, I did not see
anybody get a penalty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Swim</span></strong></p>

<p>This was tricky, as UK open water swims had barely started due
to terrible weather this year. Got head-butted during the pre-dawn
warm-up. Glad the goggles did not break but got a grazed nasal
bridge..</p>

<p>A mass start from the beach, dashing across a few metres of sand
before wading into the surf at dawn. Seeded myself about
100<sup>th</sup> out of 1,800. Then got overtaken by about a
thousand swimmers in the first 20 minutes. It is a 2 lap
anticlockwise course with massive congestion especially on the left
side because of a left turn at the first buoy that is only about
150 metres from the start. I was literally on the marker rope on
the left and mostly had to pull myself along the rope for the first
half-mile as proper swimming was not really possible. Lots of
people went under the rope to get clear water to the left and I
don't think any of them got penalised for cheating. Next time I
would either set off far to the right or swim to the left of the
rope (putting hat with race number showing on right, so the
marshals in boats on left can't see who I am).&nbsp;</p>

<p>A little disappointed with 1:16 swim but it was not an
unpleasant experience despite the turmoil. Nice warm water with
plenty of fish visible and I avoided any significant contacts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Bike</span></strong></p>

<p>The cycle started with an hour of drizzle and apparently it has
never previously rained at lanazarote ironman in its history of
over 20 years. Just like being back home, so no problem for me.</p>

<p>There is hardly any traffic on the island and much of the bike
course is closed road. A single 112 mile loop around the island
with a great mix of long straight bits to "go aero" as well as hill
climbs and some technical descents. Good surface except for a
couple of miles on a dreadful road reminiscent of Paris-Rubaix.</p>

<p>Plenty of drink stations in sensible places, so you only need
one bottle on the bike at a time. Grab a water bottle first and
gulp down half then pour rest over yourself to cool down. Grab a
bottle of energy drink to put in bottle cage that will sustain
fluid intake until the next drink station.</p>

<p>Some very windy bits mean that discs are discouraged. I used
Zipp 303 and Zipp 808, 11-27 cassette and 42/55 q-rings. Had no
problems with the high winds or climbing the steep hills with this
set up.</p>

<p>My usual slow swim put me near the back of the field, so I
enjoyed overtaking nearly 700 cyclists. The first half was slower
than planned at only around 18mph. I really got pedalling over the
second half of the course and managed an average of 19mph overall
for the 112 miles in a pleasing sub-6 time of 5:53.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Run</span></strong></p>

<p>Feeling confident following 2:56 London Marathon a month
previously. Left T2 with 7:20 on the clock. Needed a 3:15 marathon
to secure an Ironman PB.</p>

<p>Mostly flat coastal tarmac run with nice views. Set off doing
7:15 minute miles and overtook maybe 200 runners in first
half-marathon. Weather got roasting hot after a while and I hit the
wall at mile 18 then trudged home doing 12:00 minutes per mile. Saw
all those PB hopes and Kona aspirations slip away. Finished run in
3:54 and was surprised it wasn't a lot slower having been overtaken
by a couple of hundred runners in the last few miles. Nevertheless,
it was absolutely awesome to finish an exhilarating race.</p>

<p>At Lanzarote they seem to let everyone run into the finish
banner (not just the winner). Grabbed banner triumphantly and
raised it above my head with a big grin like Chrissie Wellington.
Then got photo taken shaking hands with the race director (who
presented my medal). Nice touch, being treated much the same as the
race winner.</p>

<p><strong><span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Epilogue</span></strong></p>

<p>Next day, I attended my first Kona slot roll-down ceremony. It
was good seeing Bart from Holland punch the air and praise the
heavens, as the last of the 3 slots in our age group rolled down to
him. I had chatted to Bart as we checked tyre pressures on adjacent
&nbsp;bike racks just before the race start. Bart had come
5<sup>th</sup> in age group compared to my 16<sup>th</sup>. Not so
close as to be annoying, but close enough to give me hope for next
time. I had finished just under 30 minutes slower than Bart. Bart
had qualified for Kona via Lanzarote a few years previously and he
had advised me before this race that "it is all about the
marathon". It's easy to ask advice but harder to act on
it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many thanks to Helen, Gemma, Angus, Monty and all at MSTC for
your continued support.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Up until a week I was unsure if I would compete in this iconic
race again as I had pulled my left calf muscle at the Ardingly
Standard Triathlon on 2/6/13. But as race day drew nearer, the
injury had improved and as this would be my last visit to
Wimbleball I made the decision to go ahead!!!</p>

<p>I drove there on Saturday and had an uneventful journey. On
arrival I went through the registration procedure, sorted my kit
out into the blue and red bags provided and racked my bike. The
weather during the day was a mixture of wind, rain and sun, which
then started me thinking, " hope it gets better by tomorrow, why
did I decide to come!!" I attended the race briefing at 16.00hrs
and then made my way to my digs about twenty minutes drive. It's a
lovely old farmhouse sat in a hillside which overlooks one of the
downhill sections of the bike course.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
After the usual fitful nights sleep [no I wasn't having fits!!!] I
had my normal bowl of porridge and drove to the race venue arriving
about 05.00hrs. It was chilly, overcast and windy and I thought
maybe the sun would come out later!!! I met up with Peter Court
[from MSTC, always nice to know someone] who was also taking part.
Well we completed our final preparations and it was time to get the
old wet suit on!&nbsp;</p>

<p>At about 06.45 our wave, the second, [only ever been one wave
before!! ] made our way down to the lake. The first wave had just
started and we were asked to enter the water, no turning back
now!!! Having walked through the mud and weeds I immersed myself
into the water thinking this is like a warm bath, well I knew it
wasn't but it helps mentally. The temperature was cold but I have
swam in colder water!!! Done a few strokes to warm up and impress
the opposition and then the gun went off, definitely no turning
back now!!!</p>

<p>The swim went okay with the usual disruptions of others swimming
into you, over you and under you!!! I eventually came out of the
water [and no I wasn't last!!! ] and then there is the 400m run to
T1 which includes a steep grassy bank immediately you get out of
the water!!!</p>

<p>Collect blue bike bag and into the change tent where you have
the option of taking off your own wet suit or having assistance.
Being old, wet and cold I decided to do it myself!!! Luckily I had
put extra kit in the blue bike bag, so I put on a short sleeve
cycle top [ MSTC of course!! ] and then really struggled to put my
arm warmers on as I was wet and cold!! Once they were on I stuffed
a thin rain jacket into a back pocket and made my way to the bike
rack. By now the wind had picked up even more and the rain was
persistent!</p>

<p>Out of T1 and start the bike course which kicks off with 3 miles
up hill!! As I have done this race twice before I knew what to
expect in relation to the course but that doesn't make it any
easier. It is very tough, made considerably worse with the wind and
rain!! It's a two lap course involving approximately 3904ft of
climbing! As the miles went by the rain and wind got worse
eventually forcing me to stop and put on the rain jacket!! The
descents were quite dangerous in the rain as some involved very
sharp left hand turns at the bottom!! All part of the fun and
another reason for doing this race yet AGAIN!!! I managed all the
climbs without getting off the bike, passing many that thought
walking was the best option and they were a lot younger than me!!!
Just before the end of the bike section I had a very negative
thought! I was very wet and very cold and said to myself " do you
really want to run a half marathon now!!!"</p>

<p>Anyway I got into T2 racked my bike still with a few negative
thoughts but then I was in the change tent with my red run bag and
the next thing I know I am out on the run course!! What happened
there!! Maybe it was a C.R.A.F.T. moment!! Well at least the rain
had eased but it was still windy and by now the off road course was
very muddy in places. The first of the three laps was hard, the
second even harder and well the third was just bloody awful but I
was determined to finish what I had started. Never say never!!! I
eventually crossed the line to the roar of the crowd in a very
disappointing 8hrs 2mins 56secs !!&nbsp; That was my slowest
recorded time at Wimbleball but I still managed to come 3rd in my
age group!!</p>

<p>Most importantly I finished, didn't have any injuries and after
all it is only a race!! I am trying hard to make myself feel
better!! I hope our three week annual holiday in Skiathos, which
starts this Wednesday, will help to ease the disappointment and
maybe I can figure out what went wrong!!! Sorry there are no split
times as at the time of writing this I couldn't seem to find them
on the website.[another C.R.A.F.T. moment!! ] Probably just as well
as that would really piss me off!!!!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I would like to thank Peter Court as he was waiting for me at the
finish to cheer me through and I am sure he was as tired as me!! On
a final note, good luck to anyone racing while I am away and I
promise to practise my swimming!!!! Thanks everyone for your
support on Facebook.</p>

<p>PS just found my split times!! Do you really want to see them, I
think not!!! Oh well if you want a laugh;</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>When I told some of you that I was returning to Essex to
participate in a middle distance triathlon, I'm sure you were
picturing me swimming amongst discarded shopping trollies , cycling
around burnt out cars and running through a travellers site wearing
my Burberry tri suit and then returning to transition to find my
bike on bricks with my new carbon wheels missing !&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well I can assure you it was nothing like that ! Fambridge is a
picturesque village beside the River Crouch . The swim was a two
lap circuit around the moored yachts and old Thames barges , I
thought I was doing well but did struggle when we turned into the
tide ,I was just pleased that I wasn't the last out of the water
this time . The cycle route was two laps of a completely flat
course through more quaint villages . Again I felt reasonably
comfortable on the ride. The run was a four lap mainly off road
route which included a path along side the river . I finished
&nbsp;the run without having to walk any part which again was
something I had done in past middle distance events . My split
times were 1.9km swim 55 min , 90km bike 3.23 and 18km run&nbsp;<a
href="/x-apple-data-detectors:/1/">1:52</a>&nbsp;. My total time
was 6 hours and 18 minutes!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whilst I am pleased with my time , I'm still worried that I have
to double this distance in August !&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the race most of the competitors relaxed in the garden of
the nearby Ferry Boat Inn , I even bumped into some old team mates
from Billericay rugby club who like me turned to triathlon once
their playing days were over .&nbsp;</p>

<p>I proudly wore my mid Sussex outfit back in my old manor , as
much as I love Sussex , I'm always defensive of Essex as it is a
nice place which is much maligned due to a minority of people who
live there.&nbsp;</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Pippa Crouch, Steve Birchall, Helen Graham and Jim Graham completed the Enduroman Middle Distance Triathlon in the New Forest in ideal conditions on 2/6/13.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Pre-race</strong></p>

<p>This was a massive challenge for Helen, who is a keen runner but
relatively new to triathlon (previous experience limited to a
couple of sprint triathlons). Pippa, Steve and Jim are<br />
 seasoned long distance triathletes.</p>

<p>Helen's preparation was severely limited, initially by other
commitments and then by a cycling accident. Practically all Helen's
swimming and cycling training was to be done in the<br />
 fortnight before the race, but the first cycle training session on
Preston Park Cycle Track ended in severe cuts and bruises when a
dog ran into her front wheel at 20mph. The broken skin and limb
pains had just 10 days to recover before the race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The venue and course</strong></p>

<p>Very good value for money. About a third the cost of official
ironman. Free camping next to swim start and/or cheap rooms
provided on-site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Avon Tyrell Estate hosts the annual Enduroman Ultra
Triathlon Festival, with half, single and double iron-distance
races plus a 100-mile ultramarathon occurring simultaneously on the
same course. Great atmosphere in a picturesque setting. The
previous couple of years have seen very wet and windy weather. This
year, the conditions were perfect with sunshine and dry
roads/paths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything is on one site, so you can walk to the race briefing
and transition etc. Nice lake swim with repeated laps of just a few
hundred metres each.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great cycle through the New Forest with all left turns and not
much traffic. Repeated 1.1 mile run laps through the grounds of the
estate, on dirt tracks and paths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The race</strong></p>

<p>A relatively small field of competitors with a friendly
atmosphere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SWIM</strong></p>

<p>The women's swim start was 90 mins before the men's. Steve and
Jim cheered on Pippa and Helen as they completed their swim. Pippa
was one of the first out of the water as expected. Helen had a
massive smile as she finished the swim far quicker than she
believed possible. Steve's swim was close to the fastest of the day
and Jim was middle of the pack as usual.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BIKE</strong></p>

<p>An enjoyable safe ride on decent surfaces with only left turns
and hardly any traffic. A mixture of flat, hilly, straight and
technical sections (but nothing very challenging). Not a fast
course, as it is longer than the usual middle distance cycle plus
there are several slow passes of the Avon Tyrell courtyard fuelling
station. Jim had raced this course previously<br />
 and this helped him secure the fastest cycle time. All four from
MSTC completed the cycle without incident (major result for
Helen).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RUN</strong></p>

<p>Challenging run up and down dirt paths within the Estate. Passed
the courtyard fuelling station every 1.1 miles to get drinks, gels
and cheers from supporters.</p>

<p>Speeding past tired athletes, who were doing longer distance
events on the same course, helped to keep our spirits up.</p>

<p>Enduroman tradition dictates that one completes the final run
lap in reverse direction, in order to high-five everyone still out
on the course. Jim was pleasantly surprised to find he finished his
penultimate run lap without seeing anybody running in the opposite
direction (never been in the lead before and never previously won a
race).</p>

<p>Steve and Pippa completed their runs with good form to produced
fast finish times (17th male and 9th female respectively). Helen
saved her best for last and she was the 7th fastest female runner
(11th fastest female overall).<br />

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Rachel Baker, Ant Grey, Rob Hoodless &amp; Martin Shoesmith rode
the Crawley Wheelers evening 10 last week (11th July).</p>

<p>Rachel set a new club record for a 10 mile time trial. Taking
23.44 to complete the challenging G10/58 course (which runs along
the A24 between Rusper and Southwater), she broke through the
coveted 25mph barrier for the first time. Her speed was an amazing
25.28mph average over the 10 miles.</p>

<p>Rachel rode over from Haywards Heath with Ant and Martin, an
excellent warm up before the main event, then broke the club record
and her PB, by over a minute.</p>

<p>Rachel said she had a perfect ride, and was absolutely delighted
with her performance. Conditions were ideal, a still and warm
evening and with competitors leaving at 30sec intervals, it made
for exciting racing.well as exciting as times trials ever get!</p>

<p>If you wish to set your own 10 PB, join the MSTC team, who leave
at 6.50pm from the Ship Pub car park, Cuckfield. Race entries are
accepted on the night, £4 for non Crawley Wheeler members.</p>

Graeme Jeffery took part in this event, achieving a sterling result despite the small bike.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>After a positive showing at Worthing in the sprint triathlon the
weekend before where I finished 4th, I was mostly looking forward
to my first Olympic distance event of the year down in Seaford. My
friend had kindly lent me his TT bike after I had somehow managed
to crack the top tube on my own bike a couple of weeks before - a
super slick machine with a Zipp disc wheel at the back. Only
problem was I am 6 ft tall and my friend is about 5'6" so every
time I rode the bike my knees would bang into my elbows.<br />
<br />
 On Saturday the weather was gorgeous: no wind, no waves, sunny and
warm. At the best of times my swimming resembles a drowning man and
this race was not much different although I guess I managed to
drown with at least "some" style coming out of the water in 11th
place and sprinting up the steep shingle into T1. Aaaargh, Idiot!
Having mounted my tri shoes on the bike I had forgotten to open up
the straps on the shoes so I wobbled my way down the first 50m of
the bike course getting my feet in. Right, time to monster. Seaford
is a pan flat bike along the prom so it was relatively uneventful.
The biggest challenge is counting 12 laps and avoid being taken out
on the 22 180 degree turns you have to make but I survived intact
and could see that I had made some gains on the cycle leg. A quick
T2 and out onto the run. Where is everyone and who is the guy on
the bike in front of me? It took me a good 30 seconds to realise
I'd run out first. This was a unique experience for me and I spent
the next 9.75km torturing myself with the thought that someone was
going to run past me. My paranoia definitely helped me step on the
gas and I managed to hang on to cross the line in 1st place, very
proudly wearing my MSTC tri suit, of course! The last time I did
this race in 2005 took me nearly 3 hours so pretty happy with that
improvement!</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[A lot of triathletes have a love-hate relationship with alcohol. We love to drink it, but hate what it does to both our bodies and training potential. But what is the truth about alcohol and should you be wary of it?]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Q: What are your guidelines for drinking alcohol?<br />
 A</strong>: Research shows that in moderation, alcohol,
particularly red wine, does carry some health benefits (in wine,
it's heart-healthy antioxidants). Formal recommendations for
consumption are one drink per day for women and two for men, but
it's important to remember that everyone metabolizes and tolerates
alcohol differently. Click on the tabs on the left for some other
common alcohol-related queries I hear from triathletes.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will it make me fat?<br />
 A</strong>: Alcohol is relatively high in calories (7 calories per
gram in pure alcohol). For the athlete looking to trim body fat,
cutting out alcohol is perhaps the easiest way to achieve desired
results on the scale. However, for the triathlete who trains well
and eats well most of the time, the occasional glass won't
detrimentally affect body weight.</p>

<p><strong>Q: When is the best time to have a drink?<br />
 A</strong>: Enjoying your favorite cocktail at the end of the day
can be a way to relax and help strike some life/training balance.
In fact, some of the athletes at the very top of the sport do
exactly that. For multiple Ironman 70.3 winner Kelly Williamson,
drinking a good IPA brew while cooking dinner signifies that the
day is done. "It's something I truly enjoy," she says. "I know that
practically speaking, a regular beer will not negatively affect my
training or racing. On the contrary, I think it helps me because I
would probably be grumpy and resentful of my profession if I told
myself that I couldn't have it!"</p>

<p>For 2010 Ironman world champion Mirinda Carfrae and her ITU
World Long Course champion partner Tim O'Donnell, a bottle of good
wine is a regular at the dinner table: "Tim and I enjoy a glass or
two of wine with dinner a few nights per week," she says. "I don't
think it takes anything away from training (unless we go for bottle
number two) and, in fact, I think it helps me unwind and relax
after a long day."</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are post-race beers OK?<br />
 A</strong>: There are definitely drinks and snacks better suited
to promoting recovery. However, when you consider the primary goals
of recovery are to replace fluids, restore glycogen and assist in
repair, beer doesn't stack up too badly. While alcohol can be
dehydrating due to its diuretic effects, the truth is that a drink
will not dehydrate you if it provides more fluids than the rate of
diuresis. So for beer, particularly light beer, you are actually
drinking more fluids than you will expel. The carbohydrate content
of beer also helps to replace depleted glycogen. Beer's main
drawback is the lack of protein to promote tissue repair. Where one
or two finish-line beers are just fine, over-indulgence will hinder
recovery-by making you less likely to follow good recovery
practices (stretching, eating well, getting a massage).</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Water too hot for wetsuit swim. Thrashed around in Lake Zurich for nearly 2 hours then had a perfect cycle, followed by exhaustion by mile 15 of the marathon with temperature over 30 degrees.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I trained diligently for Ironman Zurich but the non-neoprene
swim drained the energy reserves and also piled on the minutes.</p>

<p>I only took up swimming to do triathlon and I have only ever
really been interested in wet-suit outdoor races. Hence, an
effective leg-kick has not been developed. Lack of wetsuit did not
seem to bother the top swimmers as they don't need the
buoyancy.</p>

<p>The cycle went perfectly to plan with average pace of 20mph and
heart rate average below 140 (only crept up to 145 very briefly on
a couple of occasions). Terrific bike course with several
spectacularly scenic sections. Combination of flats, hills and some
sharp turns. Maximum speed 47 mph. This is the part that made it
all worthwhile.</p>

<p>The run pace was conservative due to the conditions and
resignation that the poor swim had destroyed Kona aspirations.
Nevertheless, by mile 15 there was nothing left in the tank.</p>

<p>Personal best cycle of 5:31 (beating my Challenge Roth 2012
effort by 6 mins)</p>

<p>Worst ever swim of 1:55 (45 mins slower than expected)</p>

<p>Worst ever run of 5:43 (did London Marathon 3 months ago in
2:56)</p>

<p>Slowest ever overall finish time of 13:18</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(These sentences are taken from an email sent to finishers after
the event).</p>

<p>This year´s race goes down as <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">the hardest competition ever
realized in Zurich</span>. Not only because of the heat but also
because of the non-wetsuit swim which was an additional challenge
for many athletes."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bottom-line</p>

<p>Ironman Switzerland is a good race that is highly recommended
(Challenge Roth by contrast is a great race...just a bit better in
all ways, especially crowd-support and race management).</p>

<p>Lake Zurich is beautiful with clean water. Probably a very
pleasant swim under normal conditions.</p>

<p>The cycle is terrific but has a few sharp turns combined with
steep descents that could prove tricky in the wet (and it often
does rain in Zurich). Lots of rules and novel ways to get in the
penalty box (such as non-aerobar sections and&nbsp; no-overtaking
sections).</p>

<p>The run has several underpasses and switch-backs but lots of
crowd support and feed-stations.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[triathletes started arriving and comparing bikes. Take-away was planned, purchased, and consumed ]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Now having historically spent a fortune on pre-race hotels and
then arriving "in the nick of time" to rack my bike in the morning,
I observed that many triathlons have adjoining campsites, and
thought this could reduce stress levels on the day. So three weeks
before the race found me walking around camping shops looking at
tents, discarding any that did not have enough room inside them for
my bike, an exercise mat, sufficient storage space for race stuff,
space for a large inflatable mattress, oh, and sleeping/living
space for my long suffering wife.</p>

<p>After identifying the object I required, 3 days of watching and
waiting on E-bay boiled down to an electronic game of chicken with
my winning bid arriving 2 seconds before the auction ended. 1 x
Outwell Montana 6 tent is now in my possession. Phase one of my
plan was complete, phase two (going racing) could now commence.</p>

<p>After a leisurely drive to Tamworth, we arrived at the West
Midlands Water centre in plenty of time to register on the
Saturday, pitched our tent, sat back and waited 26mins for the
kettle to boil via the 12v power supply. Our next door neighbours
then arrived with their "charming" children, and promptly started
having a domestic before striking camp and arguing about which car
the kids would travel in for the journey home (and which one of
them would therefore have to "put up with them").</p>

<p>The allure of camping was becoming clear to me.</p>

<p>Once they left however, things started looking up as other
triathletes started arriving and comparing bikes. Take-away was
planned, purchased, and consumed - and I retired to my bed which
was kitted out with feather pillows and a duck down duvet (my wife
does not do sleeping bags).</p>

<p>I awoke&nbsp;at 5:30am&nbsp;to force down my pre-race breakfast
of oat bars, bananas, and fluid. By&nbsp;06:10the bike was racked
and I had achieved a PB in the porta-loo.</p>

<p>Now, whilst it is great to be on-site with zero stress, I now
had everything ready with 1hr 20mins until race start. An
unprecedented level of organisation for me.</p>

<p>Race brief followed, with a small panic when I noticed that
no-one else had the same colour swim hat as me - it appears the BTF
were using this event to get rid of their odd stock, and the colour
bore no relation to my wave. Wetsuits were optional at 19.5 deg,
but as I sink like a stone without one, I opted to keep mine
on.</p>

<p>Everyone appeared to be organising themselves according to the
swim lanes at the Dolphin, so I joined my fellow "athletes" on the
far left and we got given the horn. Off I went drafting where I
could and for once steering a pretty good course to the 750m buoy.
Downhill to the finish line and out the water in an uneventful
27mins, but just to stop me getting too cocky, my tri suit zipper
tag got caught in my wetsuit zip, and my first flap of the day
began in earnest.</p>

<p>Problem solved in the 150m run to the bike, and my T1 began
properly. Drills were OK, and another 100m run with the bike put me
at the mount line.</p>

<p>So excited was I to be racing, I had gone about two miles before
I realised my Garmin 310 was still showing timing for "T1" - so
accurate pacing of my bike effort was going to be down to judgement
rather than data. After about 10mins, I realised I had a shadow,
and I spent the next 55mins swapping places with my new "friend"
exchanging a bit of good natured banter each time. Nutrition worked
well, with gels and water going down at a well-judged 15mins before
the bike element ended.</p>

<p>The bike course itself was great with two loops of a course that
has a couple of hills, but nothing too challenging. There was a
very tight 90deg left hander which one guy screwed up taking out a
Volvo coming the opposite way. He ended up with a dislocated
shoulder, but the Volvo will need a new wing, bonnet, windscreen,
and roof, as he managed to dent to break all of these on his way to
the other side of the road.</p>

<p>Anyway, into T2 (slick drills on removing feet from shoes), and
out onto the run pausing only to take on more fluid.</p>

<p>My biking buddy (Stuart) put on a spurt and came past me as we
came out of T2, and we started our four lap run at
about&nbsp;7:30&nbsp;pace. Each lap took us up and over a huge
earth berm (about 80foot tall and 600ft long), and after the first
lap I succeeded in getting ahead of Stuart. I then spent the next
two laps overtaking another racer only for him to take offense and
put in a spurt, so after wearing him out a bit by doing it a few
times deliberately, I put in a big push and dropped him (heh, heh,
heh). One more lap and we reached the finish. Big sprint, great
finish, and then heard my new PB time over the tannoy - 2:22:17 -
oh yes, who's the daddy.</p>

<p>Grabbed some water, and turned to shout encouragement for Stuart
as he came into the finishing straight - I had a great race with
him, and he with me.</p>

<p>The event was superb, the marshalls excellent, and I made some
new friends - it kind of sums up triathlons.</p>

<p>Looking forward to racing again on
the&nbsp;22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;September&nbsp;at the Portsmouth
Triathlon - closed road racing should make for a fast race! Our
campsite in Southsea has already been identified - but I will be
buying a kettle that boils quickly.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>My triathlon journey has been a long one, my first one London
2003 was done as a charity challenge and the Olympic distance was
completed in 3 hours and 56 minutes!<br />
<br />
 My first mid Sussex triathlon was the following year, I finished
in 193<sup>rd</sup> place out of 195 with a time of 1 hour and 50
minutes!&nbsp; Over the years I enjoyed the multi discipline of
triathlon but never really took it seriously until I joined the
MSTC last year. So enrolling to do an Ironman was a big big
challenge for me!<br />
<br />
 The preparation for the Ironman had gone reasonably well up until
three weeks before race day when I strained a calf muscle on a
steady lunchtime run. I did not do any further exercise apart from
swimming until the big day, now that's what you call
tapering!!<br />
<br />
 A delayed set off and horrendous traffic meant we arrived in
Bolton a lot later than expected and didn't get chance to register
or attend the first timers briefing , this meant we had to do a lot
more running around pre race day than expected . We did however get
everything done and I enjoyed a chicken and pasta meal and was able
to settled and relax in the room to get an early night! Now you
would have thought that a hotel that doubles its standard rate for
the Ironman weekend would not hold a wedding reception the night
before hundreds of triathlete's had to rise at 4 am to complete one
of the toughest endurance races going! Of course they did, two
floors below our room, people outside shouting, cars hooting until
after 2 am, just what you need.<br />
<br />
 Notwithstanding this race morning went well, I awoke at 4.30 am to
have my usual pre training breakfast of some cereal bars, bananas
and a hot mug of tea, the only plus side of the hotel was that it
was a 5 minute walk from the swim start at Pennington flash, I was
therefore able to put my wetsuit on in the room and walk directly
to the lake.<br />
<br />
 We were ushered into the water for a prompt 6am start, I was
planning to go to the back of the mass start but inadvertently
found myself right in the middle of the pack, this made the first
few hundred meters interesting with lots of arms and legs flailing
everywhere. It did soon settle down and I managed to swim at the
pace I wanted to. All the coaching I had received and the swims at
Ardingly had paid off as I felt comfortable throughout the 3.8km
swim and exited the lake in 94 minutes, which was around the time I
had estimated.<br />
<br />
 I took my time in T1 to ensure that I was ready for what I
expected would be a seven hours on the bike , the only glitch was
that I had managed to lock the buttons on my Garmin and was
therefore unable to get it to operate after the swim ! The bike
ride started well I seemed to overtake more people than overtook me
and I managed to continue doing this even when I started to eat the
buffet I had prepared on my crossbar. As those of you who have
completed Bolton know the main feature of the bike ride is Sheep
House lane, it's bad enough the first time let alone the third,
most of my training rides had been from one point to another,
having to do three 50 km laps really seemed to affect my enthusiasm
and I was really feeling tired by the third lap. The third climb
was really tough and not wanting to do the walk of shame I kept
digging in but this caused my quads to cramp a few times which was
quite unpleasant. I kept the wheels turning albeit very slowly
.This was further impounded by a change in the weather as
torrential rain had joined the wind that was already quite strong.
I was secretly hoping to finish the bike course in less than seven
hours but actually finished ten minutes short of eight hours,
towards the end of the ride I was really feeling fatigued and
couldn't wait to reach T2 and dump my beloved bike.<br />
<br />
 I had stayed on my bike for the whole duration so I enjoyed a walk
and stretch around T2 wondering where I was going to get the energy
to run a marathon. As I started my run I seemed to regain my
enthusiasm, running was a luxury after spending that long on the
bike! I knew I still had just under seven hours to run my marathon
, I kept informing myself that even I could do that ! Even in the
first few miles I passed people who were already walking, I wanted
to run as long as I could without having to stop, I did this for
probably the first 25 km or so. After an initial point to point run
there was again three 10k laps to complete, again this didn't help,
knowing you still had to do the same run another two times after
completing the first lap. I kept at it though and even started to
believe I would now become an ironman, I started walking up the
steep parts of the route, the continuous rain seemed to help and
the vocal support of the locals really spurred me on! Complete
strangers shouting your name really does help you along! I stopped
each time at the feed stations and took on anything now, gels,
drinks I had never heard of, I even drank cheap cola. I was
certainly getting my money's worth ! Entering the final lap seemed
to give me a new found burst of energy , my quads and calf's still
felt really tight and my knee and ankle joints were hurting like
hell but I know had the determination to get this over with and
decided that I was not going to walk any of the last lap , I kept
running even at a slow pace and felt good as I passed many people ,
as I turned to finish the last turn I knew I had about 5km to go ,
I continued running as I knew that finishing before 9pm ( 15 hours
) was possible . Even setting myself this target I did still have
to have a rest and walk parts as even the downhill was hurting my
knees. These breaks were short and I did run for the remainder of
the race , it was such a relief to turn into the finish and hear
the noise of the spectators at the finish line , although I wasn't
quite expecting what confronted me , the noise , spotlights ,
camera flashbulbs , this was my minute of fame ! I almost felt like
a celebrity! I wish now that I had savoured it more and had stopped
to embrace my wife and family and walk over the line high - fiving
all the kids along the finish straight, but I just wanted to get
over that line and went for the grandstand finish and ran to it. I
was seven minutes over the 15 hours but that was irrelevant now! I
had done it , as the announcer bellowed from the sound system "
Dean you are an Ironman "<br />
<br />
 So back to the Ironman's logo of anything is possible , well this
time last year I never ever thought I would be able to finish an
Ironman and if Dean Allen can do it anyone of YOU can do it !<br />
<br />
 Many of my fellow club members have been so instrumental in
helping me achieve this goal, your advice; coaching, training and
race tips, support and encouragement gave me the confidence to
believe that "anything is possible ". My sincere thanks go to you
all! Thanks also to those of you who have sponsored me; I have
raised nearly two grand for Help for Heroes.<br />
<br />
 I also want to make special mention to Jeff Woodall who trained so
hard for Ironman 2013 only to have been seriously injured in an
accident two weeks before the event. Jeff would have finished a lot
quicker than I did. Hope you are there next year mate!<br />

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[BAR 2013 Race 8 Middle Distance

13 people and one relay squad went for the long course, 18 and one relay team for the short course, 6 just did a swim, and 4 others did other distances (a bit of a mixture).]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>After all the recent good weather, it was a bit of a shock when
we awoke to pouring rain for the 4<sup>th</sup> Middle Distance
Race. The long course was exactly the same format as in previous
years, but this time there was a short distance option, and in the
end the majority of competitors took it, no doubt influenced by the
weather.</p>

<p>13 people and one relay squad went for the long course, 18 and
one relay team for the short course, 6 just did a swim, and 4
others did other distances (a bit of a mixture).</p>

<p>The race got under way at 7.45am, just a few minutes late, to
allow time for the EGM to vote for a change in the club
constitution. Once done everyone got in the water and there was a
short countdown to the start. As the countdown got down to 3 there
was a flurry of activity and Steve Mac dived in to just make the
start in time.</p>

<p>There were 43 swimmers at the start, so there was plenty of
action, but it was Dave Gorley who rapidly pulled away from the
field, and completed the 1900m swim in 31.49, nearly 3 minutes
ahead of Neil Giles, who is not exactly slow!!</p>

<p>After the swim both Mike John and Steve Mac had to pull out,
both were feeling queasy - Mike had a bug and felt too unwell to
continue. That was a shame as he has been training well.</p>

<p>Everyone knows how challenging the bike circuit is, whether it
is one circuit or two. Unfortunately a few people got confused as
to whether they were doing 1 or 2 laps and tried to go round again.
Next year we will get some more specific signs for this!!</p>

<p>If the bike course was not hard enough, Loz and Lucy both got
affected by punctures. Lucy did the sensible thing and waited to be
rescued, but Loz was on a mission - he just kept riding flat out
with a flat rear tyre. He got away with it for a few miles but
eventually the tyre came off the rim, and he was riding on
aluminium. The bike became difficult to handle and he came off at
one stage, and was forced to cut the second lap short in the
interests of safety. By the time he came in to T2 - it was not the
sight of his wrecked wheel but the sound it was making - I have
heard quieter tractors!!</p>

<p>Dave Gorley was unaware of Loz's problems and pushed really hard
on the run. His winning time of 4h43m35s was excellent but missed
out on James Dear's 2012 course record by 14 seconds!!</p>

<p>Both John and Kate MacTear kept going extremely well, and ended
up winning the BAR race and are the MSTC Middle Distance Champions.
Dean showed his strength in recovering from his recent Ironman to
still come out and complete the long course in 7h05m - to huge
applause.</p>

<p>After the miserable weather at the start, the sun eventually
came out. By the time David Ricketts got the BBQ going, the
conditions were perfect for relaxing and enjoying everyone's
company.</p>

<p>Leicester Tri Club won the Inter Club competition comfortably -
taking back the trophy that we won last year.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people who helped out. It is a 'no-frills' race,
but everyone mucked in with the registration and body marking, and
Roger and Graeme were around most of the day timekeeping. (There
may be some errors or missing times, so if there are any
corrections please let me know). Also thanks to Tim and Claire and
to the guys at the Activity Centre.</p>

<p>I haven't mentioned many specific times or performances but the
results are elow:</p>

If you were at the club middle distance triathlon you may have heard an unearthly rumbling emanating from the region of my rear.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p class="standard-text">This tale begins many years ago on a dark
stormy night (OK, that last bit was poetic license) when I was a
small boy watching a television programme about Jim Peters and his
dramatic collapse at the end of the 1954 Empire Games. For those
who do not know Jim Peters was expected to win this event for
England despite the midday Melbourne heat. He had a lead of 3 1/2
miles going into the stadium but had become dehydrated and
confused, collapsing with 400 yards to go (it was before metric
existed). Thinking his rival was close behind he got up and
staggered on with the capacity crowd roaring him forward. With only
200 yards to go he collapsed again and was unable to finish the
race to take the gold medal.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 I was overwhelmed by the courage and determination of this runner.
Ever since I have harboured an admiration of endurance feats in all
sport and exploration.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Up until my 30's this admiration took a very passive form
(drinking, driving, eating - and not all at the same time) but a
gentle introduction to cycling enabled me to really feel what it
must be like to push your body and mind to its' limits. As I came
to love cycling and racing I had the opportunity to see how I could
perform. The "race of truth" is the name given to time trialling
and it is a very simple, pure test of man and machine against time.
No one to draft behind and no team tactics.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Initially I was content with 10 mile and 25 mile time trials but I
hankered for something more. 100 miles - not quite enough. 12 hours
to see how far you can go? Now that is a test of endurance.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 So, in my "prime" I became something of an expert at these
managing to come 3rd in the National Championships twice and
recording 276.5 miles at my best.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Then came mortgage, job responsibilities and (happily) family.
With these came a lack of opportunity to ride 300 miles a week in
training and an age related slowing down.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 To counteract this trend I discovered triathlon (or more precisely
a bunch of triathletes at the Dolphin bar) and a new world of
extreme pain and suffering opened itself up. As someone who didn't
learn to swim until I was 26 I was surprised to find myself able to
take on and complete an ironman.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 OK, you are asking what an earth has this got do with Zombies -
let me explain.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 If you were at the club middle distance triathlon (or indeed
within 20 miles of Ardingly) you may have heard an unearthly
rumbling emanating from the region of my rear. It was not the after
effects of "Friday night is curry night" but an unfortunate
puncture of my tyre on the downhill off camber descent into Turners
Hill. Of course I had no repair kit with me. Not thinking very
clearly I decided to try to ride on hoping to make it around the
course and complete the race. I soon got used to the bump, bump
thud of the flat tyre and the unpredictable handling and was able
to continue at a moderate speed by keeping out of the saddle. I
even became quite adept at controlling the rear wheel slide that
occurred when I strayed off the crown of the road. However by
Balcombe the noise had changed to a deep metallic rumble and the
handling was now non existent and terrifying. I stopped to take a
look and wished I hadn't. The tyre had completely disintegrated
with the sidewalls entirely missing and a small strip of rubber
nesting between the aluminium sidewalls of the rim.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 I am not sure if you have tried riding on two 3mm bits of shiny
metal but I can inform you of two notable characteristics of this
technique - you can't get much traction to move forward and you
cant get much traction to stop the bike going sideways. These
weren't desirable attributes particularly on the descent towards
the viaduct and just as undesirable on the ascent after the
viaduct. Happily I needn't have worried too much as my inner tube
decided that the steepest section of the uphill by Copyhold Lane
was the right place to wrap itself around the axle, seize the wheel
and throw me into the hedgerow. Emerging from the shrubbery I took
another glance at my £1000 Zipp disc wheel and realised that the
rim and braking surface had been more than somewhat abraded by the
top quality road surfaces that grace our part of the world (as
Austin Powers would say -&nbsp; it was "totally shagged").<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 I freed up the wheel as best I could and reluctantly teetered the
quickest route back to transition along Copyhold Lane to limit any
further damage.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 After I finished the run I was greeted by hoots of derision and
mockery as my wheel had become a source of fascination to
spectators and competitors alike in my absence.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Telling everyone that I had a 12 hour time trial the next weekend
and had no back wheel just compounded the ridicule. Mentioning that
my new bike was fitted with a special aerodynamic spares storage
box and it was empty didn't help matters. And I really shouldn't
have said that I had just sold my only suitable spare wheel.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 With no forthcoming offers of a loan ringing in my ears I went
home and sadly dismembered my pride and joy. My Zipp was
dead.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Or was it....<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Scouring the internet for bargain or second hand discs revealed a
dearth of wheels meeting my criteria - round and less than £500. An
e-mail to Zipp suggested a repair price of £800.&nbsp; So I took a
very good look at old Zippy. Whilst the delicate aluminium rim had
definitely been comprehensively reprofiled it seemed that not much
metal had been lost. Realising that I had little to lose, I set
about a 4 hour marathon of filing and sanding by hand. Doing this
by hand gave me a very good idea of how thin the aluminium was and
how sharp the edges were. Too much sanding would have left the rim
too weak to hold the tyre on and too little would have left sharp
edges that would destroy the tyre. At 2am I went to bed dreaming of
exploding tyres and man eating wheels. Zipp had been raised from
the dead. Zipp the Zombie wheel lives.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Never one to let inadequate preparation get in the way of racing I
only reassembled my bike and pumped up Zippy to (nearly) full
pressure the day before my 12 hour race. As nothing gave way
immediately I decided to go to bed and was slightly comforted by
the knowledge that Steve (A) had loaned, against good advice, his
tri-spoke as a spare.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Race day started in the usual way - pitch blackness, sense of
dread, last minute carbo-loading (which for me was 3 bits of toast
with peanut butter and bananas and a slice of cake at the HQ),
getting lost en-route to the HQ and remembering what you had
forgotten to bring just when it is too late to turn around and get
it. In my case I had forgotten to bring the spare back wheel.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 I opted for a modest 120psi as I readied my bike for the race. I
had no support crew for the first 3 hours and had taped various
bits of food to myself and my bike with 1.5 litres of High 5 to
keep me going. However, the real limiting factor would be the
afterlife of Zipp the Zombie wheel. Would it last 12 second, 12
minutes or 12 hours? Anything less than 12 hours would mean a
DNF.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 You may wonder what the state of mind is as you start a 12 hour
and I think this is critical to how you manage your physical and
psychological state as the day progresses. I viewed this as a nice
day of training at a moderate pace and if I got tired I could
always take it easy or stop for a rest.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 You may also wonder about the logistics of a 12 hour race where
the result depends on measuring how far you travel in this time
(obviously any time you spend off the bike will mean less miles)?
It is very cleverly organised so that all riders complete 3 or 4
different circuits of 10-30 miles before ending up on a "finishing"
circuit. This circuit has timekeepers every mile or so with a
spotter who identifies the rider number. When you have reached the
timekeeper just after your 12 hours are up you can stop. Your
mileage is worked out by adding the numbers of laps you did of the
first circuits, the number of laps you did of the finishing circuit
and the number of timekeepers you passed on your last lap and a
calculation of the distance you covered between the two final two
timekeepers (the one you passed just before 12 hours and the one
you passed just after 12 hours who you may have kissed for telling
you to stop).<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Like all time trials, riders start at minute intervals. Out of the
72 competitors I was number 70 and was soon enjoying the
countryside around Ashford and Rye. After a couple of hours I had
almost stopped worrying about Zipp and was buoyed by the sight of
helper at 10am. Helpers are allowed to hand you food and drink but
must not follow behind you, hand up supplies on the move or
overtake you more than once every 10 miles so we decided to have a
set point on each circuit where I would expect to see my helper.
This reduced the amount of driving he would do and meant I would
know where I could get any assistance I needed.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Being such a long event means you get to see a lot of the
marshals, riders and their helpers and I made a point of greeting
them all. After a while you can sense where you are in relation to
other riders. I had managed to catch all but 2 of the riders and
had been caught by the last man off (the favourite, last years
winner, Andy Miles) by 120 miles and was pleased that Zipp was
holding up well and, apart from an increasingly sore undercarriage,
I was holding up pretty well too. This was a nice surprise as my
training had consisted of getting shingles, not training and then
doing the club middle distance race. Of course a lot could happen
in the next 7 hours. With 6 hours to go I stopped for my first wee
(probably setting some sort of record for time and volume). At 5
hours to go I recaught number 72 and left him trailing. Even with
my diminished mental functioning I knew this meant I was in 3rd or
possibly better. Reaching the finishing circuit at 200 miles my
helper informed me that I may be first or second as I stopped again
to relieve myself over my own foot. This was possibly where things
started to unfold. I stopped being focussed on staying hydrated and
thought more about keeping my stops to a minimum to maintain my
position. I was also becoming increasingly unable to sit on my
saddle as it was the first time I had used it and it wasn't proving
as comfy as the manufacturer claimed. At 215 miles I went to take a
bottle on board but dropped its contents over my knees. This had 2
consequences of note. The first was that I would have ridden 50
miles without a drink and the second was that I had become a wasp
magnet. I noticed the wasp just a little too late and it was
probably the sting that alerted me to its presence. In trying to
brush it off I managed to get another two stings and watched in
dismay as my knee started to swell and become really stiff. I guess
I should be pleased that I didn't spill it over my shorts!<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 I could sense my slowing and by the time I had stopped for a drink
I had lost any ability to try and push on. I then managed to lose
my chain twice necessitating more stops and, more importantly, one
of my tribar pads. This left me unable to put my arm in an aero
position as there was just that really hard, bristly Velcro and a
protruding bolt to rest on. Now I was really up against it mentally
but the happy appearance of Daniel, Daisy and Alice (my long
suffering family who had come out for the last hour) made me
determined to finish.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 As the sun started to set and the breeze drop I enjoyed my last
lap at a leisurely pace along the scenic leafy lanes and said a
last thank you to the crowds (yes, really), marshals and
timekeepers. My 12 hours elapsed and I coasted to a grateful halt
with my family and helpers not far behind.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 Back at the HQ there was a lavish selection of food and many
stories of individual adventure and endurance being shared amongst
our community of long distance lunatics. As the timekeepers
reported their findings and mileages were put onto the results
board it seemed I had managed 3rd place and a total of 258 and a
bit miles.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 As I wearily packed my bike back into the car I am sure that Zippy
gave me a knowing wink. Yes Zippy the Zombie wheel lives on, and I
was the grateful dead.<br />

Peters was expected to win this event for England despite the
midday Melbourne heat. He had a lead of 3 1/2 miles going into the
stadium but had become dehydrated and confused, collapsing with 400
yards to go (it was before metric existed). Thinking his rival was
close behind he got up and staggered on with the capacity crowd
roaring him forward. With only 200 yards to go he collapsed again
and was unable to finish the race to take the gold medal.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 I was overwhelmed by the courage and determination of this runner.
Ever since I have harboured an admiration of endurance feats in all
sport and exploration.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Up until my 30's this admiration took a very passive form
(drinking, driving, eating - and not all at the same time) but a
gentle introduction to cycling enabled me to really feel what it
must be like to push your body and mind to its' limits. As I came
to love cycling and racing I had the opportunity to see how I could
perform. The "race of truth" is the name given to time trialling
and it is a very simple, pure test of man and machine against time.
No one to draft behind and no team tactics.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Initially I was content with 10 mile and 25 mile time trials but I
hankered for something more. 100 miles - not quite enough. 12 hours
to see how far you can go? Now that is a test of endurance.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 So, in my "prime" I became something of an expert at these
managing to come 3rd in the National Championships twice and
recording 276.5 miles at my best.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Then came mortgage, job responsibilities and (happily) family.
With these came a lack of opportunity to ride 300 miles a week in
training and an age related slowing down.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 To counteract this trend I discovered triathlon (or more precisely
a bunch of triathletes at the Dolphin bar) and a new world of
extreme pain and suffering opened itself up. As someone who didn't
learn to swim until I was 26 I was surprised to find myself able to
take on and complete an ironman.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 OK, you are asking what an earth has this got do with Zombies -
let me explain.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 If you were at the club middle distance triathlon (or indeed
within 20 miles of Ardingly) you may have heard an unearthly
rumbling emanating from the region of my rear. It was not the after
effects of "Friday night is curry night" but an unfortunate
puncture of my tyre on the downhill off camber descent into Turners
Hill. Of course I had no repair kit with me. Not thinking very
clearly I decided to try to ride on hoping to make it around the
course and complete the race. I soon got used to the bump, bump
thud of the flat tyre and the unpredictable handling and was able
to continue at a moderate speed by keeping out of the saddle. I
even became quite adept at controlling the rear wheel slide that
occurred when I strayed off the crown of the road. However by
Balcombe the noise had changed to a deep metallic rumble and the
handling was now non existent and terrifying. I stopped to take a
look and wished I hadn't. The tyre had completely disintegrated
with the sidewalls entirely missing and a small strip of rubber
nesting between the aluminium sidewalls of the rim.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 I am not sure if you have tried riding on two 3mm bits of shiny
metal but I can inform you of two notable characteristics of this
technique - you can't get much traction to move forward and you
cant get much traction to stop the bike going sideways. These
weren't desirable attributes particularly on the descent towards
the viaduct and just as undesirable on the ascent after the
viaduct. Happily I needn't have worried too much as my inner tube
decided that the steepest section of the uphill by Copyhold Lane
was the right place to wrap itself around the axle, seize the wheel
and throw me into the hedgerow. Emerging from the shrubbery I took
another glance at my £1000 Zipp disc wheel and realised that the
rim and braking surface had been more than somewhat abraded by the
top quality road surfaces that grace our part of the world (as
Austin Powers would say -&nbsp; it was "totally shagged").<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 I freed up the wheel as best I could and reluctantly teetered the
quickest route back to transition along Copyhold Lane to limit any
further damage.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 After I finished the run I was greeted by hoots of derision and
mockery as my wheel had become a source of fascination to
spectators and competitors alike in my absence.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Telling everyone that I had a 12 hour time trial the next weekend
and had no back wheel just compounded the ridicule. Mentioning that
my new bike was fitted with a special aerodynamic spares storage
box and it was empty didn't help matters. And I really shouldn't
have said that I had just sold my only suitable spare wheel.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 With no forthcoming offers of a loan ringing in my ears I went
home and sadly dismembered my pride and joy. My Zipp was
dead.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Or was it....<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Scouring the internet for bargain or second hand discs revealed a
dearth of wheels meeting my criteria - round and less than £500. An
e-mail to Zipp suggested a repair price of £800.&nbsp; So I took a
very good look at old Zippy. Whilst the delicate aluminium rim had
definitely been comprehensively reprofiled it seemed that not much
metal had been lost. Realising that I had little to lose, I set
about a 4 hour marathon of filing and sanding by hand. Doing this
by hand gave me a very good idea of how thin the aluminium was and
how sharp the edges were. Too much sanding would have left the rim
too weak to hold the tyre on and too little would have left sharp
edges that would destroy the tyre. At 2am I went to bed dreaming of
exploding tyres and man eating wheels. Zipp had been raised from
the dead. Zipp the Zombie wheel lives.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Never one to let inadequate preparation get in the way of racing I
only reassembled my bike and pumped up Zippy to (nearly) full
pressure the day before my 12 hour race. As nothing gave way
immediately I decided to go to bed and was slightly comforted by
the knowledge that Steve (A) had loaned, against good advice, his
tri-spoke as a spare.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Race day started in the usual way - pitch blackness, sense of
dread, last minute carbo-loading (which for me was 3 bits of toast
with peanut butter and bananas and a slice of cake at the HQ),
getting lost en-route to the HQ and remembering what you had
forgotten to bring just when it is too late to turn around and get
it. In my case I had forgotten to bring the spare back wheel.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 I opted for a modest 120psi as I readied my bike for the race. I
had no support crew for the first 3 hours and had taped various
bits of food to myself and my bike with 1.5 litres of High 5 to
keep me going. However, the real limiting factor would be the
afterlife of Zipp the Zombie wheel. Would it last 12 second, 12
minutes or 12 hours? Anything less than 12 hours would mean a
DNF.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 You may wonder what the state of mind is as you start a 12 hour
and I think this is critical to how you manage your physical and
psychological state as the day progresses. I viewed this as a nice
day of training at a moderate pace and if I got tired I could
always take it easy or stop for a rest.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 You may also wonder about the logistics of a 12 hour race where
the result depends on measuring how far you travel in this time
(obviously any time you spend off the bike will mean less miles)?
It is very cleverly organised so that all riders complete 3 or 4
different circuits of 10-30 miles before ending up on a "finishing"
circuit. This circuit has timekeepers every mile or so with a
spotter who identifies the rider number. When you have reached the
timekeeper just after your 12 hours are up you can stop. Your
mileage is worked out by adding the numbers of laps you did of the
first circuits, the number of laps you did of the finishing circuit
and the number of timekeepers you passed on your last lap and a
calculation of the distance you covered between the two final two
timekeepers (the one you passed just before 12 hours and the one
you passed just after 12 hours who you may have kissed for telling
you to stop).<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Like all time trials, riders start at minute intervals. Out of the
72 competitors I was number 70 and was soon enjoying the
countryside around Ashford and Rye. After a couple of hours I had
almost stopped worrying about Zipp and was buoyed by the sight of
helper at 10am. Helpers are allowed to hand you food and drink but
must not follow behind you, hand up supplies on the move or
overtake you more than once every 10 miles so we decided to have a
set point on each circuit where I would expect to see my helper.
This reduced the amount of driving he would do and meant I would
know where I could get any assistance I needed.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Being such a long event means you get to see a lot of the
marshals, riders and their helpers and I made a point of greeting
them all. After a while you can sense where you are in relation to
other riders. I had managed to catch all but 2 of the riders and
had been caught by the last man off (the favourite, last years
winner, Andy Miles) by 120 miles and was pleased that Zipp was
holding up well and, apart from an increasingly sore undercarriage,
I was holding up pretty well too. This was a nice surprise as my
training had consisted of getting shingles, not training and then
doing the club middle distance race. Of course a lot could happen
in the next 7 hours. With 6 hours to go I stopped for my first wee
(probably setting some sort of record for time and volume). At 5
hours to go I recaught number 72 and left him trailing. Even with
my diminished mental functioning I knew this meant I was in 3rd or
possibly better. Reaching the finishing circuit at 200 miles my
helper informed me that I may be first or second as I stopped again
to relieve myself over my own foot. This was possibly where things
started to unfold. I stopped being focussed on staying hydrated and
thought more about keeping my stops to a minimum to maintain my
position. I was also becoming increasingly unable to sit on my
saddle as it was the first time I had used it and it wasn't proving
as comfy as the manufacturer claimed. At 215 miles I went to take a
bottle on board but dropped its contents over my knees. This had 2
consequences of note. The first was that I would have ridden 50
miles without a drink and the second was that I had become a wasp
magnet. I noticed the wasp just a little too late and it was
probably the sting that alerted me to its presence. In trying to
brush it off I managed to get another two stings and watched in
dismay as my knee started to swell and become really stiff. I guess
I should be pleased that I didn't spill it over my shorts!<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 I could sense my slowing and by the time I had stopped for a drink
I had lost any ability to try and push on. I then managed to lose
my chain twice necessitating more stops and, more importantly, one
of my tribar pads. This left me unable to put my arm in an aero
position as there was just that really hard, bristly Velcro and a
protruding bolt to rest on. Now I was really up against it mentally
but the happy appearance of Daniel, Daisy and Alice (my long
suffering family who had come out for the last hour) made me
determined to finish.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 As the sun started to set and the breeze drop I enjoyed my last
lap at a leisurely pace along the scenic leafy lanes and said a
last thank you to the crowds (yes, really), marshals and
timekeepers. My 12 hours elapsed and I coasted to a grateful halt
with my family and helpers not far behind.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 Back at the HQ there was a lavish selection of food and many
stories of individual adventure and endurance being shared amongst
our community of long distance lunatics. As the timekeepers
reported their findings and mileages were put onto the results
board it seemed I had managed 3rd place and a total of 258 and a
bit miles.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 As I wearily packed my bike back into the car I am sure that Zippy
gave me a knowing wink. Yes Zippy the Zombie wheel lives on, and I
was the grateful dead.<br />

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[The race has quickly gained a reputation with challenging bike and run courses, but also for the enthusiasm of the local residents in hosting the event.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Pre-Race</strong></p>

<p>Got a late entry to IM Wales via Nirvana Travel. A triathlon
addict's impulsive last minute decision to race. Paid only a small
premium for getting a place this way after the race had sold out.
Would use Nirvana again if need be, because the package included a
great hotel (a stone's throw from race start) and free cancellation
insurance. The Nirvana rep organized a cycle course tour by car
with a local cyclist as a guide.</p>

<p>Everything (Hotels, Expo, Registration, Briefing, Transition,
Swim) is in one place at Tenby. Straightforward drive from Sussex.
Totally hassle-free. The locals are super-friendly and take great
pride in hosting the race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Swim</strong></p>

<p>Near perfect conditions with calm relatively warm waters in the
beautiful Bay. Mass beach start then an unfussy 2 lap swim,
punctuated by a short dash along the beach between laps.</p>

<p>The run to T1 is 1.3km through the centre of Tenby. Longest
transition run of all ironman races. An extra transition bag for
shoes is racked at swim exit in order to do this 1.3km run. Last
year an elite competitor lost his Kona slot because he handed his
wetsuit to his girlfriend on the way to T1 and therefore got DQ'd
after he had finished the race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Cycle</strong></p>

<p>Very scenic ride on mostly closed roads in a coastal National
Park. Some opportunities to make the most of a TT bike during the
first 50 miles, but after that the course is particularly hilly and
technical with some very steep winding downhills. My brakes were
inadequate in the wet on those steep sections, so lots of time was
lost by having to be over cautious.</p>

<p>Biggest mistake of the day was leaving my nice warm jacket in
T1. It rained several times during the ride and by mile 50, I was
freezing and shaking uncontrollably. To have accepted outside
assistance might have risked a DQ. Fortunately, I discovered that I
had got a plastic cape in my pocket (as you do), so I put it on to
get warm. Ruined the aerodynamics somewhat. During the ride, I
heard onlookers shout "go batman". After the race, I heard people
chatting about a cyclist wearing a bin bag who had become known as
"the bubble".</p>

<p>Tenby has a "heartbreak hill" that is almost as good for crowd
support as Challenge Roth. Tenby has half the competitors and less
than half the crowd numbers but the vibe is superb.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Run</strong></p>

<p>Barely a flat section on the four lap course. Lots of lively
crowd support through the town, passing pubs and hotels. Plenty of
walking uphill and running downhill. Good banter between athletes
and plenty of switchbacks to keep spotting people. Lots to take
one's mind off the usual drudgery of the ironman run. Ideal cool
temperatures and dry conditions for this part of the race. Got a
bit confused at the end of the third lap and took a wrong turn
towards the finish line. Had to double-back a few hundred metres to
restart the fourth lap. Great joy visiting the finish for the
second and final time.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>20 DQ'd for dropping litter</li>

<li>10 DQ'd for drafting</li>

<li>4 DQ'd for failing to serve a penalty</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a fast time for me (almost 2 hours slower than my Lanzarote
effort a few months earlier). Not surprising, considering the
neglect of training during 3 weeks backpacking in Sri Lanka (got
home just in time to taper 2 weeks before IM Wales).</p>

<p>Loved the race and loved the location. Usually, as I cross the
finish line I swear I'll never do another ironman. This time I
immediately rebooked the hotel for next year and paid the
registration fee as soon as entry came on-line a few days later.
Upgraded brakes and a warm cycling jacket should make Tenby 2014
even better.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[How do you find your trainers amongst 1500 other pairs..... ]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>The race is a 1km swim and a 5km run.</p>

<p>05:00 the start of what was going to be a great day except for
the 05:00 alarm call. Its great doing aquathlons as you only have a
wetsuit and trainers to sort out, but this does make transition
very strange, only a set of trainers in there nothing to set up
nothing to tinker with..... and how do you find your trainers
amongst 1500 other pairs.....<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 My start was 10:10. ITU rules are in the water 30 secs before the
horn and you have to have one hand holding the pontoon. I take up
my usual position of the centre line which is the most direct route
but quite a lot have the same idea and its a bit cramped, unlike
deep water starts you cant make space for yourself, there we are my
chest tight against some other guys back and some other guys chest
against my back a bit snug you might say.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 This is going to be a proper bun fight, I quite like a start like
that as it fires you up. Wow the klaxon went and I got proper
mullered. I have been in starts with 3000+ guys and it was not as
bad as this, pure white water fists, heads, feet really bad then
bang I take a full on hit to the right temple which moves my
goggles to my forehead... I take another at the first turn again
shifting my goggles, on both occasions I manage to get them back in
place without stopping but after the third time I thought bugger it
don't bother, they stayed in place but were full of water. I had to
remind myself that the main thing was to focus on what I was doing
and not panic, yea not panic just focus. It worked, although I
couldn't see where I was going I made the last 500m without too
much issue.</p>

<p>Out of the water in under 16 mins not too bad, the problem now
was finding my trainers amongst 1500 other pairs.</p>

<p>Lungs are burning and I realise how hard it is to run after the
swim, I pull the pace back and control my breathing and heart rate,
it works after a 1km I start to settle into a 4:30 per km pace. The
run is great although hard as I have only had about 3 runs in the
past few months but my body starts to remember what it has to
do.</p>

<p>This was a great day everyone I met was chatty and friendly and
it was an honour to compete for Ireland and hang out in the Irish
athlete tent situated opposite the GB who by far has the most
athletes there, it also worked as a great recky for the Standard
distance on Sunday.</p>

<p><br />
 Swim 15:53<br />
 T1 01:03<br />
 Run 22:49</p>

<p><strong>Total 00:39:44</strong> this puts me in 50<sup>th</sup>
AG place</p>

<p>70.3 - Half Ironman:&nbsp; Zell-A-See, Austria, Sun 1st Sept
2013<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Training gone well for the finale, my first half iron man, the
70.30 Austria.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The last three months swimming and cycling came on leaps and
bounds since I&nbsp;&nbsp;joined&nbsp; the MSTC with their coaching
and help from other&nbsp;club members.&nbsp; Open water swimming,
new and much enjoyed, albeit after a little trepidation!<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Arrived 29th August in stunning Zell-Am-See&nbsp;so had three days
to orientate ourselves with warm and sunny weather.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Spent&nbsp;some time finding our bearings, finding Transition
point and the more important, Finishing line.&nbsp; Cycled around
the lake to get a real feel of the land.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Finally, race day:-&nbsp; Rained&nbsp; through the night and all
through the swim and cycle, but did stop for the run!<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Had a great swim and cycle but blew out on the run.&nbsp; But very
happy overall with my result, better than I could have wished
for:-<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Swim:&nbsp; 00:36:35<br />
 Bike:&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:56:39<br />
 Run:&nbsp;&nbsp; 02:22:30<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Total:&nbsp; 06:10:51<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Would highly recommend this venue for a 70.3 race for achieving a
PB as bike section not too hilly and a flat run.<br />

<p>If you are too lazy to read the whole report, two things you
should know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Point 1 - in a sea swim, never trust Mike J about tidal flow -
he used to own a yacht, but that means nothing</li>

<li>Point 2 - eat a gel = drink some water</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
 For those of you willing to read on, it all started rather
pleasantly on Saturday afternoon in the sunshine registering and
then racking the bike in the secure storage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Race briefings were running all afternoon, and everyone promptly
got very confused about how many bike laps you had to do around the
dockyard and around the lake (1 and 5 - or it could be 4 - it
depends&nbsp;what you count). Most of us at that point decided to
use either GPS or the bike computer, and cycle to "bike-in" when it
got to more than 40k.</p>

<p>We headed off to our camp site to set up the tent, and promptly
realised that we had the largest spangliest tent on the site and
were surrounded by the nylon equivalent of social housing. I was
suddenly very thankful my bike was in secure racking.</p>

<p>After an hour of being the new must see attraction for the
masses, we put all valuables back into the car, and headed off to
meet up with friends for a curry. We were joined by my race buddy
Stuart from the BRAT Birmingham Triathlon, and started debating
which injuries would slow us down the following day. He took an
early lead with some form of leprosy, but I finally clinched it
with "sciatic pain from an inflamed perineum". &nbsp;Elevenariffe
will always beat Tenariffe.</p>

<p>Curry over, we returned to the campsite - but only after
securing floor space if the thieving pikey's had stolen our tent.
Luck was with us, and the tent was still standing.</p>

<p>Up at 5:20 for food and ablutions, and we headed into Portsmouth
to secure a parking space just outside the closed road circuit. We
walked onto site to find Mike and Emma J trying to convince the
race organisers to let then register on the morning rather than the
day before (as per race instructions). Obviously being a team
player I vouched for them, and all was well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Kit got laid out, tyres checked, pacing from rack entrance
to bike measured, wetsuit on, GPS turned on, and I was ready.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I walked the 200m from transition to the swim, and when I
saw Mike I tactfully mentioned that a grey swim hat (wave 2) was
for the older gents. His response was touching if rather anglo
saxon in its content.</p>

<p>Wave 1 got into the water to warm up, and a few of them <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">walked</span> out to the first
buoy.&nbsp;Cue a 15min delay as the tide was out.</p>

<p>Mike was scouting out the swim exit and offering tidal drift
advice as he had used his sailing knowledge to check tidal flow and
strength. In truth it would not make any real difference as the
course is the course, but suffice to say the advice in hindsight
appeared to be completely wrong.</p>

<p>Wave 1 went off, wave two followed, and finally wave 3 (and me)
were allowed to navigate barefoot down the shingle beach, across
the large pebbles, and into the water. In the warm up time I worked
out that I could run/walk faster than I could swim up until the sea
reached 4ft deep, and so I had my plan.</p>

<p>Off went the klaxon, and like a startled gazelle I ran through
the shallows, floundered like a girl through the mid thigh depth,
and then waded like Arnie until the early swimmers started catching
me.</p>

<p>My Navigation for once was good and the buoys all passed within
a couple of feet of me. I drafted where I could, passed a few grey
hats, and even some green (wave 1) and thought I was doing really
well (hoping for a sub 28mins). Then rounding the final buoy
heading towards the beach, I got chicked by the leader of wave 4
(the girls)! I was magnanimous in thinking that she was probably a
world champion as I was having a good swim. Out of the water and
hit the transition button on my 310XT - 37mins. THIRTY SEVEN -
WTF?????</p>

<p>Off to transition with a hugely deflated ego.</p>

<p>Transition was ok and out onto the bike course. It felt good to
be moving at speed, and even the cobbles in the dockyard were ok. I
can confirm that none of the defence budget is spent on the upkeep
of roads in naval bases as I was by this point wearing most of the
drink I was trying to take in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The course through the dockyard went past HMS Victory, and was
very tight and technical, but the 5&nbsp;laps of the boating lake
and esplanade that followed were fast and great fun. I averaged
over 21mph overall so was happy with that.</p>

<p>Into T2 which for once was quite quick, and out onto the run
course. Straight away I was feeling rubbish, which was quickly
compounded by Mike doing his impression of a racing snake and
passing me at the end of his first 5km lap. But for all that
"feeling rubbish" a glance at the 310 showed me doing 7:21 per mile
- happy days.&nbsp;Head up, keep going, catch the bugger in front
of me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I took in a gel just before the drink station at 2.5km to give
me more energy for the final third of the run - it worked for me at
the BRAT Tri earlier in the year - I took on a cup water and kept
going. The 2nd lap began to feel bad, I could feel heat building
and dehydration starting. Another cup of water at the 7.5km mark,
but it wasn't enough. At 8km my vision was going along with my
legs, and I had to stop. Head between knees for two mins, got some
blood back up into my head, stood up carefully, and kept moving
towards the finish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A marshal asked if I was ok, and I explained I was dehydrating -
a bottle of water appeared, and promptly disappeared down my throat
- I could literally feel the energy flowing back into my body - off
I went running again.</p>

<p>10mins later and I am sprinting down the finish chute thoroughly
disappointed with myself, as by then I had figured out that it was
self inflicted.</p>

<p>Why did it work at the BRAT but not here in Portsmouth? At the
BRAT it was four loops rather than two - so I had access to twice
as many water stations - simple really. Gels need water.&nbsp;Learn
from this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did I enjoy the race, yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did I get a PB, not a chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did I learn things to make me faster in the future,
yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Will I do it next year, yes - but only to prove a point to
myself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were mutterings that the swim was at least 300m too long,
but are as yet unproven.&nbsp;My GPS showed 2.04km, and as stated,
my sighting for once was good.&nbsp;Several people took over an
hour to complete the swim, and my time of 37mins would have put me
into sub 30min territory for 1500m if the mutterings were true -
much more like normal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again I have to say the marshals were great and I thanked as
many as I could en route. It was really good to do a Tri with
friends, and I even got a medal!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best of all, the tent was still there when we got back to the
campsite.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p class="xmsonormal">Well I thought getting up for the Aquathlon
was early.. 04:00&nbsp;alarm call and I was staying 5 miles from
transition, this&nbsp;was closing at 06:30 so quite an early
start.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">I approached this race&nbsp;quite confidant
after having a good race the previous Sunday at Crowborough where I
came 2<sup>nd</sup> in my age group and quite a good <a
href="/news/2013/9/13/itu-aquathlon-world-champs.aspx"
target="_blank" title="Aquathlon Report">Worlds Aquathlon</a> on
the Wednesday, 50<sup>th</sup> in the world for my AG. My injuries
were also staying calm so it looks like it could be a great day and
hanging around in the Irish team tent was great fun.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">I met up with Rachael who was also racing i'm
sure she was blue with the cold so we went off to find some rays of
sun. Unfortunately we had been informed that the swim was to be cut
to 750m so as a good swimmer I was disappointed especially as it
was nice and warm when i started but to be fair to them the
decision was made at 07:00 when the air temp was 8 degrees.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">I've learnt my lesson from the Aquathlon and
pick my swim slot carefully, in the team briefing we were told no
punching as the kayakers will be watching. I get a great clean
start no congestion and race to the first buoy (250m) with no
incidents and I'm just off the back of the lead pack. I'm
approaching another buoy&nbsp;and a guy is trying to knock me off
my line, it's a good line and I want it so we bounce off each other
for a few strokes then I catch his eye and I know there is a punch
coming, sure enough it lands, my goggles stay on but fill with
water, no issues I still have time to take my vengeance and leave
him in my wake, it's good to practice with full goggles as once you
get used to it it's not that bad. I have a last 300m sprint with a
few guys and come out of the water just in front of them so quite a
good swim.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">The run to transition is long and goes on
forever T1 - 03:44 the longest to date (my last Ironman one was
03:37),&nbsp;Wow the roars of the crowds are amazing 3-4 deep on
both sides. I'm in my national Irish kit so get loads of "Go on
Ireland". You set off at a great pace to start the first lap which
goes around most of the park then out into London on closed roads,
again all lined with people shouting and cheering, the crowds are
mostly concentrated within the park and are very enthusiastic. I
spot Kay, my sister and her lad and some friends from the Midlands
they are waving the Irish flag for me. Next I spot the Goodheads
with their big smiles and cheers it really spurs you on, out into
London on what is an iconic route unfortunately I'm a bit blinkered
and don't see most of it, I am supposed to be racing after all, I
go past the palace and notice the flag is up, I wonder if Queenie
is watching me. Snapped out of that train of thought by a roar from
Tim and Claire.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Bit more effort as there is a murderous
headwind and for a supposedly flat course it's quite hard, a quick
rant with a bunch of&nbsp;15 drafters&nbsp;pointing out
that&nbsp;they might as well be drug cheats, the course loops back
down the Mall and I spot Phil Couch marshalling and he gives me a
big cheer. The Bike route was&nbsp;great just a shame I didn't get
to see much but to ride around London at those speeds is something
very special you don't get to do often.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">One issue I have is with irresponsible dog
owners, I am myself a dog owner and if I am near a road I put my
dog on a lead especially if there is a bike race going past. Im on
a slight downhill in Hyde Park doing around 27mph on my tri bars
and I spot a loose dog.. Tour de France style I think, sure enough
out onto the road in front of me he trots, if I hit it its bad for
both of us. I can't break or slow down so I let out a big roar that
luckily scares the dog to a stand still, and probably everyone else
around, I&nbsp;swerve and miss it by an inch or two, seconds later
I see a marshal running up to that position hopefully to have ago
at that idiot owner.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Back to transition, I opted to get off my
bike unusually with my shoes on as it's a long muddy transition and
we are not allowed a towel to clean our feet. i have to run up what
feels like a mountain, again its a very long run in transition
before we can head to our rack the bike. T2 - 04:08 again a record
(my last Ironman one was 03:33).</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Now my nemesis the run, its only 3 laps to
make up the&nbsp;10km. When I started down this world championship
road my target was 40mins or less for the run, with the injuries
that had to change to a conservative 45mins still a good goal.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">The run start was just as amazing&nbsp;as the
bike start, all the cheers just made you smile and feel great, I
must have high 5 everyone in the first mile. I spot Rob and Ben
Hoodless again big smiles and shouts of encouragement also&nbsp;Kay
and my family. I don't think my feet touched the ground in that
first lap even at the top of what was quite a sharp hill and trust
the Goodheads to be there at the top high 5's at the ready. Onto
the second lap still going well getting carried along on the wave
of encouragement. Needless to say that around 6km my smiles
stopped.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">The blue carpet of the finish chute comes
into vision then the line ,I cross happy in the knowledge that its
all over. Now where's the pub.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">What a great day and even better week the
honour of racing for your country twice in a week and the amazing
amount of support not only from my family&nbsp;and MSTC but also
the general public its something that will stay with me for
years.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Swim&nbsp; - 00:12:06</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Brighton to Brighton Sportive organised by SRS Events and running in a big loop from Hove Lawns out westwards to Shoreham, Henfield, Partridge Green and all points west.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another month and another race - this time the Brighton to
Brighton Sportive organised by SRS Events and running in a big loop
from Hove Lawns out westwards to Shoreham, Henfield, Partridge
Green and all points west.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I missed this race, last year, after having an altercation with
a straw bale, on a bend, at the Blenheim Triathlon and once again
ending up on the slab and under Dave Rickett's scalpel. Peter
Court, Graeme Fitzjohn and Woodyboy all did it in 2012 and were
quick to appraise me of what a good event I had missed. This year
it was Jeff's turn to sit it out, after introducing an aerial
forward roll into his cycling skills and shattering both his
cycling helmet and his left scapula when re-introduced to terra
firma. So Graeme/Peter whose sitting it out next year??</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, after months of training where Peter and I had dragged
Graeme around Sussex every Sunday morning to the point where we
knew he could ride for 5 hours+ and cover over 75 miles, we found
Sunday dawning clear and bright. Down on Hove Lawns the foolhardy
assembled good and early with a gentle 15 mph wind blowing from the
east (fun out, in yer face coming back). Registration and
collection of the timing chip was painless and Peter, Graeme and I
were joined by the ever youthful, ever cheerful Del Hastings,
replete in Club colours. Rupert Robinson showed up, forming part of
an Evans Cycling team and being hardcore that he is, nothing less
than the Classic (101 miles) for him. We satisfied ourselves with
the 83 miler (Challenge).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once registered, there was no holding back and we were out onto
the seafront road swishing along towards Shoreham at a rapid pace
and on really quite good road surfaces!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After months of training, and with peletons everywhere, it was
relatively easy to latch onto groups but the quick pace (circa
37kph) was probably a bit too much and eventually the four amigos
settled into a rhythm but it was clear that Graeme &amp; Del were
happier at a less frantic cadence and so we split. The roads were
lovely, the drivers considerate and with the wind at our backs we
hurtled across Sussex and Surrey before arriving at the turning
point (47 miles) at Kirdford. At this point Peter and I parted
company, on his orders, as I was despatched after the only rider to
have been through. I just saw him as he headed out, as we headed in
and so I set chase after the man in SKY kit on a black
Boardman.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After weeks of cycling as a training group, it felt odd to out
on my own trying to chase down the lead man. Matters were not
helped just towards Billingshurst were a lady driving a Range Rover
seemed to take exception to my being on the road and tore up behind
me with her horn blaring &nbsp;and gesticulating at me as she shot
by. Being the shy and sensitive sort did I a) burst in to tears: or
b) scream wildly back and give the full repertoire of hand signals?
Well it was probably at this moment, I completely missed a right
hand turn and shortly later found myself at a roundabout at which
time, with no arrows to assist, I did that unheard of thing for a
bloke and stopped to look at the map. Now this was easier said than
done, as the print was small and my reading glasses were 30 miles
away in Burgess Hill but I reckoned (or guessed) that I had to head
south, so I cycled on into Billingshurst and hung a right onto the
A29. About a mile later (and later looking at a map realising I
added over a 2 miles to my journey) I came to a roundabout and "eh
voila!" there were the signs. The hunt was back on!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well the rest of the journey flew by. At Ashington I locked onto
the Worthing Excelsior boys and they saw me to Steyning and then it
was the Club Sunday Tea shop route in reverse until Edburton where
it was along the foot of The Downs towards The Devil's Dyke -
&nbsp;and there was my quarry! I had trouble closing him down as we
pedalled up the Dyke but once I was on the flat it was just a
question of time before I caught him at Shirley Drive. The run down
to Hove sea front was fine but the lights were a pain. I crossed
the finishing line in a PB needing to beat 6 hrs to achieve Gold,
so doing it in under 5 hrs was a massive result.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was lovely to wait on the line and see the boys come safely
home and as we left the Lawns, Rupert was just returning to.
Definitely one for next year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have had a trawl of the results and as far as I can see 8 Club
Members took part:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rupert Robinson (M41) - 6.11.49 GOLD - 101 miles</li>

<li>Paul Newsome (M26) - 4.51.29 - GOLD - 83 Miles</li>

<li>Andy Miles (M54) - 4.51.55 - GOLD -(included an extra few miles
because I felt like it)</li>

<li>Mike Jaffe (M49) - 4.57.14 - GOLD</li>

<li>Peter Court (M52) - 5.06.06 - GOLD</li>

<li>Del Hastings (M67) - 5.30.20 - GOLD (time included 12 mins
helping Graeme change an inner tube)</li>

<li>Matt Gibson (M39) - 5.59.59 - SILVER</li>

<li>Graeme Fitzjohn (M48) - 6.00.50 SILVER (included the 12 minute
inner tube change!!)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well done to all involved and see you all soon when the Turbo
sessions start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ps Really pleased to see that I am as tranquil as ever and that
the competitive streak has disappeared.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Horsted Keynes Triathlon on Sunday 6th October.
]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<div>This year's revived Horsted Keynes Triathlon brought out a
great mixture of semi-pro athletes and first timers. It is these -
slightly eccentric - events that are the breeding ground for our
sport......and so it was proved to be at this year's event on
Sunday 6th October.</div>

<div>Beautiful crisp weather greeted the start of the event where
Paul Hedger took the teams and individuals through the race
briefing. As I looked around I could see the cream of MSTC's
finest.....Messrs Wintergold, Hoodless, Alden and others......as
well as many (quite obvious) newbies. &nbsp;But I could also see
many children including Ben Hoodless, Rob's 13 year old son,
complete in his yellow and black tri-suit. My own daughter Harriet,
12, was less well kitted out but you could see in both of them an
athletic posture and determination. &nbsp;Both of them had entered
the Horsted Individual Shortie, a 200m swim, 5k bike and 2.5k run.
&nbsp;Call it a taster but there was definitely nothing stopping
the two of them giving 100%.&nbsp;</div>

<div>They both blasted off on the swim and you could tell both of
them have been well taught (and practiced) in the pool. Ben went
out strongly on the bike on roads he knows well, and chaperoned by
Rachel Baker (no question of drafting of course). Then a quick
transition on the village green into the two lap run with strong
legs under blue skies. &nbsp;I was escorting Harriet on the bike
and on the run.</div>

<div>This was what the fun part of our sport is
about......competitors of every age going as hard as they can,
families gathered, laughter and cheers everywhere, mucking in with
marshalling, having a pint afterwards. &nbsp;You don't expect your
kids to like everything that you like.....but it feels good to see
them getting stuck in and having some success. &nbsp;<span
class="ecxApple-style-span">B<span class="ecxApple-style-span">oth
them gave it their all and came in strongly in each of the 3
disciplines</span></span><span
class="ecxApple-style-span">.</span></div>

<div>Ben is definitely one to watch in the future. &nbsp;He won the
Men's Shorties event and took the Village Cup. &nbsp;Harriet was
2nd overall although the organisers awarded her the winner before
taking it away 20 mins later! C'est la vie. More importantly both
of them had a great time and I'm sure will be at other events next
year. &nbsp;I suppose a trip to Evans might be in order for
Harriet's Christmas present.</div>

<div>Ben Hoodless: 3.43 swim, 15.50 bike, 14.56 run</div>

<div>Harriet Record: 3.44 swim, 23.33 bike, 15.13 run</div>

<div><br />
<div>Mat Record</div>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>On behalf of my wife and I, the time has come (allowing for
mental and physical healing) &nbsp;to provide an update on the NDW
100 (or what turned out to be NDW103). &nbsp;</p>

<p>I assert that this is quite problematic as those looking in
can't understand it and those looking out can't explain it.
&nbsp;For that I reason I feel the best way to provide insight into
the event is through an explanation of the psychology behind
Ultradistance running with the added benefit of providing an
indication of your propensity to partake in the sport. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you answer yes in more than:</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp; 50% of the questions then it is considered a positive
response</li>

<li>&gt;70% and you should seek counselling or drop me a line about
what races the MidSussex UltraDistance &amp; Cake Appreciation
Society (AKA MUCAS) will be partaking in over the next 12
months.</li>

<li>&gt; 90% then consider yourself an honorary member of the club
and come to our next "meeting"!</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>When you see 100 miles to go on a motorway, do you think that
would be a good run but could you do it in 24hrs?</li>

<li>Would you consider the additional 3 miles in the NDW100 as
bonus
miles?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>When people mention cake, do you have a Pavlovian
response?</li>

a day out rather than drive?</li>

<li>Do you own more shoes than your significant other - or at least
compete on the number of trainers you have?</li>

<li>When you go for a run, do you see things that you should not
see?</li>

<li>Do you take more medication than an 80 year old stroke
sufferer?</li>

<li>Do you respect athletes that no one else has heard of?</li>

<li>Do you carry toilet paper when you leave the house?</li>

<li>Does is disturb you to relieve yourself outdoors?</li>

<li>Do you feel people who think about barefoot running, forefoot
running, pronation and supination are interesting people?</li>

<li>Have you purchased a pair of&nbsp; barefoot running shoes and
live with the injuries to show for it?</li>

(yes = no, no = yes)</li>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>What is it?<br />
 5 x iron/day format.<br />
 Total of 19k swim, 900k bike &amp; 211k run in 80hr40sec.</p>

<p>Where is it?<br />
 Monterrey, Nuevo León , Mexico, 18-22 Nov 13.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monterrey was like I expected a Mexican city to be... colourful,
but a bit crappy with lots of heavily armed police in big trucks.
Even race site security had kevlar helmets and semi-automatics.
There is quite a lot of drug related gang violence in Mexico.</p>

<p>Type in 'Monterrey deca' in Google and it comes up 'Monterrey
decapitation'; last year 49 mutilated bodies were found in one of
Monterrey's municipal parks. But most of the violence is
gang-on-gang so I guess it's pretty safe... you just hope not to be
caught up in any crossfire or that they don't take a dislike to
your lycra bike shorts.</p>

<p>However, we found most of the locals to be charming. The race
venue was Parque Espana where we swam in an open air 50m pool in
wetsuits, and completed bike &amp; run loops around the park.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/27582/Quintuple2_300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Quintuple2.png" style="float: right;"/></p>

<p>The bike course was very juddery; after day 1 I took to wearing
2 bike shorts to dampen the vibration.</p>

<p>The weather was variable, from 31'C in baking hot sun on day 1
down to 6'C on the last day. We also had thunderstorms and
torrential rain. Strong winds on day 5 brought down a power line so
that it was held up by a tree only feet above our heads on the bike
course.</p>

<p>In Europe the race would have been suspended for H&amp;S (half
way through the final day) ... but I needn't have worried... this
was Mexico; some park employees built some sort of gantry to raise
the line higher above our heads while we continued to cycle
underneath.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/27587/Quintuple3_200x302.jpg" width="200" height="302" alt="Quintuple3.png" style="float: left;"/></p>

<p>Some people don't like the idea of short looped courses that are
often a feature of ultra distance triathlons but there are
benefits.&nbsp;You're never that far away from your support crew or
medical attention if necessary. During the event you get to know
the other competitors (double, triple, quin &amp; deca) as you
occasionally run and bike together, offering each other support or
telling jokes.</p>

<p>I was able to witness the fascinating duel between Kamil Suran
and Antal Voneki as they battled it out for title of IUTA
(International Ultra Triathlon Association... governing body of
ultra dist tris) World Champion 2013. &nbsp;</p>

<p>They both came to the race with similar points so winning the
continuous deca would be decisive. Half way through their 422k run
they were still within 4k of each other!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/27592/Quintuple4_300x202.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Quintuple4.png" style="float: right;"/></p>

<p>(Right: Kamil, taking a short nap during 422k run. Note ice
bags)</p>

<p>By day 3 you've got yourself and support crew into a pattern. A
daily routine of discomfort becomes your new 'reality' and
acceptance of it is necessary. The discomfort (aka pain) and
fatigue involved normally comes in waves, and it is vital to remain
upbeat. Everybody was managing 'issues'.</p>

<p>Mine was a dodgy back; in March I had prolapsed a lumbar disc
and torn another. That had severely disrupted my training and I had
to miss 2 build up races over the summer. I owe a debt of gratitude
to the pain specialist at the Nuffield. He scheduled a root nerve
injection for me a couple of weeks before so that the optimum
window of benefit would coincide with the race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/27597/Quintuple5_300x453.jpg" width="200" height="NaN" alt="Quintuple5.png" style="float: left;"/></p>

<p>Lugging my bike box and the long flight didn't help... the days
before the race it was causing me pain again just to walk around
town. During each swim I had to limit the power I put into the
stroke to keep my back happy, but the juddery bike course was the
worst part. Normally I enjoy the bike the most, but each day I
couldn't wait to get to the marathon.</p>

<p>Note to self day 3: 'tell my wife not to let me do anymore of
these races!</p>

<p>Completing these races would not have been possible without a
lot of support. The ladies in the 24hr race kitchen would make you
anything.... as long as it was Mexican.</p>

<p>My eldest son Ben was my race crew. He has crewed a few of these
races for me. Ben did a fantastic job of looking after his Dad, and
I couldn't have done the race without him.</p>

<p>As well monitoring/managing my hydration, nutrition and
electrolyte intake he was always thinking of innovative ways to
take care of me like putting sandwich bags of ice in my bike jersey
back pockets to keep me cool or duct taping a bag of ice into a
neck scarf for the run. We also had a great time hanging out in
Mexico before and after the race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/27602/Quintuple6_300x453.jpg" width="250" height="NaN" alt="Quintuple6.png" style="float: right;"/></p>

<p>The last 5k of the run on day 5 produced my fastest run splits
as I was just so excited about the</p>

<p>prospect of finishing... finally. I had forgotten my day 3 'note
to self' and was already thinking about the next challenge...?</p>

<p><br />
 Ultra distance triathlon is not going to be everybody's cup of tea
but recommended if you think you'd enjoy small intimate races with
great camaraderie and the opportunity to explore your personal
mental and physical endurance. You don't have to be fast; you just
need to keep moving.</p>

<p>My back is a lot happier now that I've stopped provoking
it.&nbsp;</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Burgess Hill Winter Classic - 77.2 miles not the 75 miles and the wind is blowing like mad ]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Woke up Sunday morning to the wind blowing like mad and thought
do I really need to be doing this ride!!</p>

<p>On arrival at Cyprus Hall Burgess Hill to sign on I found out
that the ride would be 77.2 miles not the 75 miles&nbsp;I
thought!!! Oh well what's a couple of extra miles!!</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was nobody else from MSTC doing the long
ride so I was on my own!! There were a number of other like minded
people doing the ride but all looked a lot younger than me! Anyway
having signed on I started at 08.36 and headed out West through
Ashurst, West Washington, West Chiltington, Billingshurst,
Wisborough Green, Loxwood and onto Ellens Green, which was
basically the turn round point.</p>

<p>I stopped very briefly to get my timing chip swiped and to
refuel. The journey to here had been uneventful, although there was
a lot of surface water in places at least it wasn't raining!! But
the wind was just terrible which reduced the average speed
somewhat!</p>

<p>After a few minutes at this stop I headed out on the return
journey saying to myself "it's only another 35 miles" and if you
looked at the map the right way up it was all down hill !!!!!! Who
was I kidding!!!</p>

<p>The ride back went through Broadbridge Heath, Barn's Green,
Southwater, West Grinstead, Ashurst, Partridge Green, Alborne,
Hassocks, HurstpierPoint, Keymer and back to Burgess Hill to the
Cyprus Hall.</p>

<p>Well it wasn't down hill coming back and the wind was bloody
worse!!! But at least it didn't rain!!!</p>

<p>I arrived in one piece after a very tough ride. My timing chip
time was 5hrs 14 mins 43 secs [the Gold Standard for my age group
OAP was 5hrs 30 mins] so I was well pleased with that, especially
as my actual riding time was 5hrs 7 mins on my computer.</p>

<p><br />
Will I be back next year??? Of course I will!!!!<br />
 &nbsp;<br />

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>As I had not done this race since 2005 I was a little
apprehensive to say the least. My time then was 1hr 37 mins but now
that I am in my late 60's I knew that I wasn't going to beat
that!!! Although it was a respectable start time, 10.30 am, I was
up early as usual and&nbsp;had my porridge like a good "boy". I
left home about 8.00 and arrived at the designated car park with no
problems at 9.00 giving me plenty of time to chill out before the
start and of course my warm up, a walk to the loo and back!!<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On arrival at the start, which was approximately 10 mins walk
from the car park I met up with Kevin [James]. The weather was
reasonably warm and dry with a slight wind, so was probably ideal
running conditions. Just before we lined up Steve [Birchall] and
Pippa [ Crouch] turned up.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then it was gun time and there was no turning back! We all know
Hastings is a hilly course but exactly how hilly I had forgotten as
it was 9yrs ago the last time I did this race! Obviously another
C.R.A.F.T. moment!!! The first 5 miles is basically up hill, so
there is got to be a "down" somewhere!! The crowds were very
encouraging along the way, which always helps, plenty of jelly
babies being given out! Once I got to mile 7 I thought well there
is only 6 miles to go!!<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dropping down out of Hastings Old town you then find yourself at
mile 11 on the seafront and that always seems like a lot further
than 2 miles to the finish! With just under a mile to go you can
see the finish but it feels like someone keeps moving it further
away!! I ran the whole way round and even had some left in the tank
for those last two miles. With about half&nbsp; a mile to go Jules
Stuart- Colwill]&nbsp;came up alongside me and we were nip and tuck
til just before this finish line when Jules had that extra bit in
her tank and crossed over just before me,&nbsp;well done
Jules!!<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My race time was 2hrs 2 mins 36 secs<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My personal time was 2hrs.1 min 48secs</p>

<p><br />
 Will I do it next year, maybe if I have another C.R.A.F.T.
moment!!!</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[It was great to see so many members of MSTC at last Sunday's Balcombe Bull Run.  The cross-country course was tougher than expected, and a lovely bit of hail thrown in for good measure.  Thanks to Mark Jordan for being the "tail runner" on the day to ensure even the slowest competitors were kept in safe hands.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Bright sunshine and a crisp wind greeted the 73 entrants in
Balcombe's first Bull Run - a circular, 7.3km cross-country run
over the fields, lanes, styles and footpaths of our beautiful
village. &nbsp;We even had a bit of hail thrown in to give it that
tougher feel!<br />
<br />
 Dave Jones (an ex-pupil of the school and successful triathete)
and I had laid out the course the night before with reflective
signs. The day started early with the PTA cooking up bacon
sandwiches and refreshments for the gathering runners and
supporters. Then we briefed the 18 marshals, who had offered to
keep a watchful eye over the runners, and gave the runners a race
briefing. Harriet Record got everyone in the mood with a warm-up
before I called the runners to the start line.</p>

<p><br />
 Looking over to it I could see a wonderful mix of runners - from
the young (12) to the older (60+), from the experienced to the fun
runner. There was fancy running kit on show and one competitor who
I'm sure was wearing surf shorts! It is so rewarding to see people
raring to go and getting stuck in. Jackie Stone blew the air horn
to start and the race was off. It's amazing that even before they
reached the top of Westup Lane the runners were strung out - from
the gazelles to the steam engines....<br />
<br />
 They continued along Rowhill Lane, passed Spicers Farm (where
David Vickerstaff had set up a water table) before going onto
Postman's Walk and across the fields to Westup Farm and back home.
This was a muddy, hilly and tough course - not to mention the added
hail. I was astounded at the pace of Rob Watts (mens winner in 28m
14sec), Rachel Baker (ladies winner 36.14), Eleanor Stoner (girls
winner 37.15) and James Greetham (boys winner 44.28). Well done to
you all.<br />
<br />
 A big crowd had assembled at the finish and the noise was awesome.
Everyone was given a cow bell medal, bananas and water. And the
winners got some lovely hats. The cakes and bacon "sardines" (as my
Facebook entry said - damn autocorrect!) were laid on by the PTA -
perfect recovery food after a race.<br />
<br />
 My thanks to everyone who ran, helped and supported on the day. We
made over £500 for the school and also secured a regular event in
Balcombe's diary. Bring on Balcombe Bull Run 2015!<br />
<br />

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[It is not a race, everyone is timed over their respective course. ]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I did&nbsp; this ride last year but opted for the Challenge
route 54 miles, so this year I was going for the Classic route of
71 miles!!</p>

<p>At registration I met up with Jeff Woodall, Andy Miles and
Graeme Fitzjohn. Jeff and I were doing the long ride and Andy and
Graeme were doing the 54 mile route.&nbsp;The ride started at 8.30
am from Burgess Hill, although it is not a race, everyone is timed
over their respective course.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weather was kind as well, mild, a bit cloudy with a slight
wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all started together but Jeff was after a
personal best time and went off like a rocket, not to be seen again
til we met up in the food hall at the finish!!!</p>

<p>I stuck with Andy until my chain came off after I went through
the ford at Pillow Mounds Hill. I don't know how Graeme and Andy
got on during the ride as I never saw either of them again.</p>

<p>The Classic route takes in Ashdown Forest and travels into parts
of Kent and Surrey. There are five notable hilly sections on the
route with Pillow Mounds Hill being the first, where you have to
cross a ford before starting the climb. Once I got my chain back on
I got stuck into the climb and completed that without any problems.
The miles went by and then it was Kidds Hill, known locally as "the
Wall". I have been up here several times but it is still a sit in
the saddle and grind away type of hill and kicks again very steeply
just before the summit.</p>

<p>By now I was well warmed up and looking forward to the Col du
Groombridge [ Groombridge Hill ], this one has no run up and must
be shown respect. These hills certainly cut down your average
speed!!!<img src="/media/31670/Del Kidds Hill_177x198.jpg" width="207" height="265" alt="Del Kidds Hill.jpg" style="float: left;"/></p>

<p>I arrived at Hever [ which was the timing stop ] in 2hrs 43
mins. had a quick pit stop,&nbsp;picked up a bit of food and was on
my way again. As I was leaving the feed station I checked my bike
computer but alas it was no longer attached to my bike!!! Obviously
I had been travelling so fast that&nbsp;it must have flown
off!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having&nbsp; made my way back via Hartfield , Forest Row and
onto West Hoathly the next thrill to look forward too was looming
up, the infamous Cobb Lane!!! It is short but has a 20% gradient
and can be a cleat breaker as it's known as "the walk of shame" as
many riders are forced to walk it!!! To make matters worse the
official photographer is always there to record the " shame or the
agony"!!! Well it was not the "walk of shame" for me but it was
agony!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then it was on through Ardingly to what I thought was&nbsp;the
final set of hills by the reservoir, short but steep. But there was
yet another hill to climb up Deakes Lane into Ansty and then crack
on to Burgess Hill to the finish.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 I met up with Jeff in the food hall and found out that he had
problems with his bike at one of the feed stations which delayed
him somewhat&nbsp;and that had put paid to him achieving a "Gold
Standard".</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p>I've got&nbsp;to say that was one of the toughest rides I have
done!!! I have also sent an email to the organisers to ask why the
Gold Standard for over 60's was 4hrs 55mins and yet the Gold
Standard for the Winter Classic [ which was 77 miles but only an
undulating course] for over 60's was 5hrs 30 mins which I completed
in 5hrs 15mins.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-Race</span>:
Weather forecasts predicted heavy rain and high winds, so few
people expected fast times. It seemed the end of Brighton's charmed
run of consistently great weather for every marathon.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Race-Day</span>: Mild,
cloudy weather with moderate wind and sunshine for the finish.
Several international athletes graced the start-line and an
impressive course record of 2:09:25 was set by William Chebor
(despite having to stop mid-race to re-tie a shoe-lace!).</p>

<p>New PB's for Emma, Helen and Jim. Not sure if Anthony, Ben,
Robin, Dean and Jean got PB's but the finish times were excellent
anyhow.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone giving support. Such a boost to hear "Go
Mid-Sussex".</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[Mike Jaffe breaks the 3-hour barrier. to celebrate 60th Anniversary of Roger Bannisters 4-minute mileand also because he wanted to do it anyway.]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Pre-Race:</p>

<p>Exciting build-up to a great race. Huge expectation as Mo Farah
prepares for marathon debut against possibly the strongest ever
field of runners ever assembled for this distance.</p>

<p>Perfect weather forecasted. Bought loads of race kit at the
fantastic expo at the ExCel (kit that could not be used for race
because it had not been used for training).</p>

<p>Travelled up to London on race day by train along with thousands
of participants and supporters. Great atmosphere.</p>

<p>Jim and Helen wore their legs out the week before at Brighton
Marathon. Emma had just recovered from a nasty tummy virus. Mike
had no excuses.</p>

<p>Jim and Helen got text messages an hour or two before the start,
because TV coverage was showing clips of them filmed at the expo a
few days earlier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Race:</p>

<p>Nearly 36,000 runners and maybe 150,000 supporters in ideal
conditions in a well organised big city marathon. Amazing
experience. Your name being shouted out by spectators every step of
the way. Running across Tower Bridge and past other monuments with
no traffic.</p>

<p>Emma, Helen, Mike and Jim were lucky enough to be in
good-for-age pens, so everyone running at similar pace and no major
bottle-necks.</p>

<p>Emma and Helen ran together for most of the race. Mike and Jim
were together until mile 16, when Jim's legs turned to lead.</p>

<p>Emma and Helen ran good fast races and both got close to their
personal bests.</p>

<p>Jim slowed progressively in the last 10 miles and was overtaken
by an astronaut wearing a massive helmet plus a bride in a wedding
dress.</p>

<p>Mike cruised the final mile, knowing he was on target, and
savoured every moment as he crossed the line in 2:59. A personal
best.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Post-Race:</p>

<p>Lots of fun and games trying to all meet up amongst crowds of
runners and spectators, without mobile phone coverage because
everyone was texting simultaneously.</p>

<p>Mo did a good debut, coming 8<sup>th</sup> and beat the current
Olympic Champion (amongst others) but he was a minute slower than
Steve Jones' 30 year old British record of 2:07 (which included a
toilet-break incredibly).</p>

<p>The results software is quite sophisticated. Mike finished
faster than 96% of the entire field and he overtook 111 runners in
the last 5miles. Jim was overtaken by 1,022 runners in the last 5
miles (but he did manage to overtake 9 runners during that
time).</p>

<p>It was fantastic to get texts and facebook messages from
well-wishers. A big "thank you" to all at MSTC for their
support.</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>The Boston Marathon has a special place in the marathon calendar
and for good reason.&nbsp; It is the longest continuously running
marathon, starting in 1897 and now on its 118th edition. It is also
significant because almost all of the field have to achieve a
Boston qualification time (a "BQ" in the language of American club
runners) to get there. And clearly this year's Boston marathon also
took on more significance with the Boston bombings in 2013 that
took the lives of three spectators and injured or maimed race
participants.</p>

<p><br />
 My journey to Boston was on the Saturday before the race on
Patriots Day (Monday 21 April), but - to pardon the cliché - the
journey had started a long time before that.&nbsp; My original
intention was to BQ at the Rome Marathon in 2006!&nbsp;
Unfortunately, I was just outside 3:10 qualifying standard and
after a break I returned to marathons in 2011.</p>

<p>Various 'failures' at Brighton 3:24 and Portsmouth suggested my
times were going south of my target.&nbsp; Finally, I got the time
at Chester in 3:02, and again at Manchester 2:58 which now meant I
had to apply.&nbsp; (Note: In the end the number of qualifiers
achieving the 3:10 standard for my age group was quite high, so the
cut-off ended up being 3.08 for 35-39 year old males - which could
have been quite disappointing had I training to get just within
3:10).</p>

<p><br />
 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The build
up</strong></span><br />
 The build up for the race had been fairly good for me averaging 35
miles per week, although I lost a block of time in the 'peak month'
before the race with a tonsillitis/scarlet fever combo and my
preparation races - Hastings Half and the Worthing 20 were a bit
down on the year before. Nevertheless, I had the feeling that I was
good to scrape under 3 hours.&nbsp; This was not least because I
thought that the net elevation drop on the course meant it would be
a fast course (how very wrong was I).</p>

<p><br />
 Given the costs of the flights and accommodation I decided to go
out on my own.&nbsp; This was a blessing in many ways as it meant
not having a three and five year old with me that might not
understand the finer points of different time zones or rest before
a big race! I stayed at a hostel in downtown Boston which was
superb as it was 5 minutes from where I needed to be on race day
and was filled with other marathoners from around the
world.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 With the excitement of the race in my mind I walked to the expo
for number pick-up etc. This meant passing the finishing line,
which had already been set up. It was a sight to behold due to the
hundreds of people milling around taking shots.&nbsp; I'm not sure
many races would generate so much interest. The next day was spent
chilling out around Harvard trying desperately not to do too
much.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 Before I knew it race day was on me. The race is not conventional
as you are taken in buses from Boston Common where the race starts
26 miles west to the race start in Hopkington in rural New England
(lots of trees and nice wooden boarded houses as far as I could
tell). I sat next to a guy from San Diego who stood out as he was
wearing 'Google glass' specs that had a built recorder he used to
video the race.&nbsp; After the usual conversations about what
races we'd done, worries about the race, and what we wanted to do
we eventually got to the start.</p>

<p><br />
 There was a lot of security about but luckily it wasn't too in
your face (although someone afterwards pointed out that they saw
snipers on the roof overlooking the race village!). The problem, as
with many marathons, was waiting for race start in the cold very
early in the morning.&nbsp; Luckily the organisers were giving out
space blankets and I was thankful for it despite having purchased a
thermal top for $4 that I could chuck away.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 <strong>The race itself</strong><br />
 Thanks to my qualification time I was in the first wave of runners
that got to start at the same time as the elite men (although it
still took 2 minutes to cross the start line from the gun
going).</p>

<p><br />
 The Boston is known for a fast start and I had read that the route
drops quickly in the first four miles. However, even at this stage
there were some short sharp rises that interrupted the
downhills.&nbsp; Pacing was extremely difficult as was trying not
to go into the red on the uphill but also to keep things relaxed on
the downhill so my pace varied significantly between 7:30 to
6:30.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with a large pack of similar standard
runners, the downhills were difficult to navigate, there were a few
nasty falls by runners clipping each other, and in the congestion I
was braking (wasting energy) rather than letting gravity do the
work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 It was great to be running however as the crowds were already
amazing even in the early stages, especially going through various
small towns such as Ashland and Framingham.&nbsp; These were on the
'flat' part of the race, but there never really was a section of
level ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 Even in the early stages of the race, which started at 9.30, the
sun was pretty strong and I was having to take on water at most of
the water stations at every mile.&nbsp; But I was ticking along
nicely and in the first half of the race I was consistently on
sub-three pace. I passed the half-way point at 1:29:30 feeling ok
but not super.&nbsp;<br />
 It was just after half way that I heard the 'scream tunnel' - this
is the section of the route where the Wellesley College Girls are
out in force.&nbsp; It was certainly high decibel and high
frequency for a significant amount of time. It is Boston tradition
apparently to stop for a snog and there were many amusing signs
inviting runners to do so, but with race times still on my mind
and, given the ages of the girls, concerns about scarring them for
life I pressed on through the hormone highway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Between miles 13-16 I was drifting slightly above race pace and
started to have the nagging doubts about what was to
come.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 In the run-up to the race I had heard a lot about the difficulty
of the Boston marathon due to infamous 'Heartbreak Hill' at mile
21.&nbsp; What proved to be the killer for me though was the
cumulative effects of the ups and downs already in my legs; the
heat which drifted up to over 20 degrees on the day; and the Newton
Hills, a series of tough uphills starting from mile 16 onwards. My
goal pre-race had been to allow my pace to drift up and get enough
back on the downhills and the last five miles after
Heartbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 On the day however this wasn't going to happen as the uphills were
far tougher than I had anticipated (at least in terms of running at
the pace I wanted to).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 Check the profile (in grey) for yourself!<br />
 <img src="/media/32547/Boston_500x159.jpg" width="500" height="159" alt="Boston.jpg"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 At points my pace was painfully slow drifting above 9 minute pace
and by the end of Heartbreak I was totally shot both mentally and
physically as I was no longer on target for sub-3 hour and there
was no getting that time back given my legs or the weather. But
halfway up Heartbreak Hill I was determined to carry on running
hard and just to enjoy the atmosphere. I got a bit of a kick out of
the crowd and just looking around at the suffering on everyone's
faces.&nbsp; There were sub-3 hour guys and girls all around me,
some walking the hills (with 5 miles still left) and others pushing
through and me somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p><br />
 I was now nearing the centre of Boston with crowd noise seemed to
increase exponentially. A combination of American's outgoing nature
(unlike Brits who might politely give a "well done" or clap, they
cheer at the top of their voices), the passion for the event after
last year, and the constant ringing of cow-bells made it almost
over whelming.&nbsp; By that time it was a pure pain but at the
same time the emotion coming from the crowd kept me going. It was
unbelievable to see so many top runners stopping, limping, and
walking at that point in the race, which pays testament to the
difficultly of the course.<br />
 Finally however I made it onto Boyston Street, turning a left hand
corner for a 500 metre 'sprint' to the
line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
 Post-race was a mix of joy (at finishing), tinged with mild
disappointment at my time (3:12), and the agony in my legs (the
worst ever).&nbsp; Nevertheless, as I reflected on the race over a
couple of beers immediately after the race and my time became less
important. I realised that Boston Marathon was so much better for
its difficultly. With the defiance of the city after last year's
bombing, it was also great just to be part of an experience and to
understand the "Boston Strong" motto the city has adopted. This
will stick with me far more than my results sheet.&nbsp;<br />

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>93 miles !!!! seemed like a good idea when I entered months
ago!</p>

<p>Considering I hadn't ridden that distance since I rode across
Australia in 2001, I thought I had bitten off more than I could
chew!!!</p>

<p>I went to bed Saturday night secretly hoping that it would be
raining so hard in the morning that I would have an excuse not to
ride!!! Well it wasn't raining in the morning but it was very windy
as I made my way to Burgess Hill to the start [ by van as I didn't
want to add even more miles!!!] .</p>

<p>Once I got signed in there was turning back and before I knew it
I was on my way. After about 5 miles it was time to tackle
Ditchling Beacon, followed by a fast descent down Coldean Lane.
Then it was up Coombe Road , Bear Road and onto the coast road
through to Newhaven before heading inland via Lewes.</p>

<p>The route then took us out to Laughton and continued through
various villages and MANY hills heading towards Mayfield. At one
point following the "arrow signs" I took a right turn and after
about two miles of going down a lovely hill I realised that I
hadn't seen another "arrow sign" and my fears were confirmed when I
saw a sign post for Battle and Hastings!!!</p>

<p>A quick consultation with my map and I had to ride another two
miles back up the same hill I had just flew down!! As I passed the
turning I had previously come out of I realised that the wind had
turned the "arrow sign" completely the opposite way!!! [ or did I
have a C.R.A.F.T. moment!!] Oh well I thought what's another 4
miles on top of 93.!!!!</p>

<p>I soon forgot my mishap and was making my way to the timing chip
check point at Mayfield. A quick pit stop here and then it was only
another 30 odd miles back to Burgess Hill!!! The hills and wind had
been relentless so far and the same pattern continued all the way
back to Burgess Hill and the finish.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>My riding time was 6hrs 53mins 41secs which gave me a Silver
Standard, missing out on the Gold by approximately 10 mins, which I
reckon was the extra 4 miles I done!!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>A glorious sunny day started at 5:15am in my own bed. For once
the triathlon I was to attempt was within 35mins of my own house.
My resident triathlon widow/driver for the day headed for the
shower and I headed for the coffee and my oaty based
breakfast+banana.</p>

<p>Prior preparation and planning had paid off for once, and though
the use of a tri-kit check list developed on my I-pad following
bitter experience, the car had been loaded the previous day and all
items ticked off. It still didn't stop my pre-race butterflies
worrying, but it helped to not do a headless chicken impression on
the morning of the race.</p>

<p>The final pre race necessity was completed in the luxury of a
non chemical environment and we were off in the car. We promptly
became stuck behind the slowest driver in Wiltshire with an
unbelievable amount of oncoming traffic preventing an overtake. At
that point my butterflies started developing an unhealthy desire to
possess and use automatic weapons.</p>

<p>Eventually we got into Bath and headed up the hill to the
university. It took about 2mins to drive up the hill at 30mph - I
sat contemplating a similar journey scheduled for about 2hrs time
to be completed by bicycle, whilst my butterflies further developed
an interesting Anglo Saxon vocabulary.</p>

<p>We arrived at the car park to the oh so familiar "pssst" sound
of bike tyres being checked - another race season had started and
it made me smile.</p>

<p>The car next to us produced a mountain bike accompanied by a
beginner triathlete who admitted the bike was her sons, and whilst
it had sort-of road tyres, she had not checked them and had never
trained on hills. For the uninitiated, the CoB triathlon has
1,005ft of accent in its 23km bike course...</p>

<p>In a fit of decency I pumped her tyres up from 20 to 55psi (max
on the tyre wall said 60), and we tried to encourage her to great
things. At least I was unlikely to be last now.</p>

<p>Registration was completed, and our labels were a very
professional set of bike and helmet stickers from sportstiks.com
that included a "supporting 116" sticker for my triathlon widow.
She declined to wear it, and I offered her the "bag label" sticker
instead - and got "that look".</p>

<p>Bike racking followed, all organised and signposted, and we
headed into the Olympic size pool for race briefing. The briefing
was good with some humour to keep you awake. One memorable moment
was when the race director confirmed that in the pool there would
be no diving, bombing, or petting! On the bike briefing, we were
told aero bars were prohibited for one of the downhill sections
because of a sharp left at the bottom, but I rarely eat chocolate
when riding, so ignored that advice.</p>

<p>We were split into groups of 8 for the swim and each group of 8
were given a lane to swim clockwise around until the magic 8 x 50m
lengths were complete. Thankfully I was scheduled to be in lane 1
so would have a ladder to get in and out with - those in the middle
lanes would have to clamber out over a foot tall diving plinth.</p>

<p>My start time came, the whistle blew, and off I went. I overtook
the swimmer in front of me at the end of the first 50m, and at the
end of the second 50m I felt a tap as someone wanted to pass me. I
let him by at the end of the length, and he promptly went 10m and
pulled up completely out of air as he had gone out too hard. Two
lengths and two casualties - I am invincible!</p>

<p>One very slow swim later (9+ mins) and I am out and running to
T1. All goes well and I am off down the road overtaking a lot of
racers as I go. The course is well marshalled and I am working hard
to keep the speed up and feeling cocky. The first decent (450ft)
cures me of that - it is fearsome. I am doing 30mph and being
passed by riders doing 40mph+ but I cannot take my hand off the
rear brake as we twist and turn down the hill. At the bottom
revenge comes my way as I power up the hill overtaking all the
40mph brigade and a few more for good measure.</p>

<p>Smile for the cameras, around the roundabout, and back the way
we came. Down the non aero hill and up the other side overtaking
others like the god amongst men I feel I must be. Back towards T2
and they sneak in a final hill I hadn't noticed on the way out
which saps your legs just when you need them for running.</p>

<p>T2 goes well, and I perform the triathlete shuffle on shaky legs
as I headed through run-out.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the run...</p>

<p>Now if on dating websites curvy=fat, then in triathlon "flat and
on good ground" translates as steep accents through soft and
occasionally mud filled woodland paths.</p>

<p>I took about a mile before I got into my stride, but once there
I felt good and covered the ground well. At the 4km mark I realised
it was on for a PB if I got my finger out, and I pushed on. At 100m
to go I turned the corner to be faced with a 3m tall ridge we had
to run up and across before the finish line would come into
view.</p>

<p>Final dash to the line aiming for the photographer, and across
we go with a new PB of 1:21:43 and I finished in the top third for
a change!</p>

<p>Tea and medals followed with the usual post race bragging with
my fellow athletes.</p>

<p>In summary it was a tough sprint race with good marshalling that
I would recommend as a warm up for the Dambuster - if only because
of the bike course. I even have a new favourite mug from my goody
bag.</p>

<p>The day finally arrived to experience a middle distance Ironman
race and i wasn't disappointed with this event. It had great
atmosphere, good competition and some hard racing with about 1900
athletes entered. This is a beautiful part of France and the
weather was ideal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking down an 800 calorie breakfast was interesting and so was
discovering I had somewhat outgrown my wetsuit from last year!
However the goal of this race was to finish strong and positive,
test out the nutrition strategy with a view to making the full
distance Ironman Nice next month a less daunting prospect.</p>

<p><strong>Swim</strong><br />
 (1.9km) - Set in a lake about 30mins by car north of Aix which
made the logistics of the event abit cumbersome due to having two
transition areas, however it was good nonetheless. &nbsp;The usual
&nbsp;washing machine affair during the first half, stayed calm,
got some space and focused on good navigation and preserving my
energy. Fortunately no contact.</p>

<p><strong>Bike</strong><br />
 (90km) - Felt pretty good after the swim but was cautious not to
push too much on the bike, wanted to finish strong on the run. Time
flew past on the ride and I learnt to be careful pacing against
others since many were doing the relay and were much fresher, it
was reasonably hilly with one 500m climb about 80km in, but what
goes up must come down and there were some fantastic fast downhill
sections afterwards. Finished in good shape for a strong run.</p>

<p><strong>Run</strong><br />
 (21.1km) - Oh dear....legs feel great, lots of energy, however my
lungs seemed to have stopped working. It was about 24degrees but
felt alot hotter for the 4 x 5km loops in the centre of town. I'm
not sure what my problem was, i now suspect the wetsuit was far too
tight and compressed my chest and maybe this was the after effect
but nevertheless I had to back right off and fortunately the great
atmosphere from the crowd around the course (and my lovely wife)
meant i finished. Whilst I would have liked to be 25mins quicker on
the run, I know this will serve as motivation for the next one.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
 Swim(39m), Bike(03:13), Run(01:56) = 06:00</p>

<p>A big thank you to MSTC whose coaches have been very helpful the
past 12 months.</p>

              <newsPrecis><![CDATA[ask Colin for his spare numberdont explain why]]></newsPrecis>
              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Paul Newsome, Colin Chamber and Martin Shoesmith traveled to the
Euro and World Sprint Qualifying event on Saturday 31<sup>st</sup>
May. Being a youngster, Paul was rewarded with a 7.30am start,
Colin and I, being very old, a 12pm start. This meant Colin and I
travel up and back in a day, leaving Cuckfield 7.45am. The event is
held in and around the international rowing center at Holme
Peirpoint, a 2km long, perfect rectangle lake, about 1.7m deep (I
could stand up).</p>

<p>Transition is interesting, it's a "double transition" area,
which means you have to leave your<br />
 running shoes in T2, all alonewith no bike for company. Which
makes finding them amongst another 249 pairs potentially tricky.
Its a good job I left a "flag"<br />
 to find mine, Colin's are bright pink so he was OK.</p>

<p>The Swim was nuts, 250 in our wave, I should have brought the
dirty washing to this big washing machine. There was a ton of weed
in the water, and for 150 meters it was getting stuck in my fingers
and feet, if we had got out at this stage, like they do at the
World Series, we would have all looked like a platoon of wetsuited
camouflaged SAS commandos. Exit from the lake is via a soft and
grippy blue carpet just like the pros, heaven. Then 4<br />
 laps around the lake on the bike.</p>

<p>The event is a Mecca for BTF Officials, we were carefully
watched from all angles, and 30 cyclist in our wave were "draft
busted". There were 2 on motorbikes following us around and around,
and Colin was pushing his luck drafting one of them. I escaped, as
I had Colin's spare number on. Then T2 to find your trainers, then
a run around the lake. On your run, you can see the finish line all
the way around the lake and it was mighty tempting to take a quick
dip across the 8 rowing lanes for my first ever 1<sup>st</sup>
place.</p>

<p><br />
 On the run in, you can see the grandstand, hear the noise of the
crowd, the blue carpet and the finish line. What a super fast time
from Paul, smashing the club record by 3 minutes, what a great
performance. Colin was on a massive PB, but a running injury ended
his chancesit still counts Colin, that's 0-2 for the year BTW. You
get your times straight away, icecream and home. I strongly
recommend this event, its top notch. Allow 3 hours for the drive,
buy bright loud trainers, and ask Colin for his spare numberdon't
explain<br />
 why. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I entered this event as I wanted a change from doing Wimbleball
again, so this was going to be a whole new experience. I drove down
to the New Forest in Hampshire on Saturday and had no problems
until I got within a few miles of the race headquarters when my sat
nav took me down a very narrow track and I mean narrow!!!
Eventually I found my way back onto the correct road through the
National Park&nbsp; avoiding the ponies and horses and into the
grounds of Avon Tyrrell House Activity Centre, which was where the
event was taking place.</p>

<p>Luckily the weather was fine as I had to park my van in the
middle of the field between the lake and the house.&nbsp;Many
vehicles&nbsp;and tents were&nbsp;already there as the different
events had started on the Friday with a Triple Enduroman [Iron
distance] and 200 mile run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saturday's events were a Double and a 100 mile run. Sunday's
programme was a Single, the Half and a 50 mile run!!</p>

<p>A real festival of endurance which was making me feel quite
inferior as I was only doing the Half!!!&nbsp;As&nbsp;I&nbsp;am too
old now to camp&nbsp;I had booked a room in the "House", so I
booked in and then had a walk around to soak up the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Not to bore you too much I'll try and explain the layout of the
area. The "House" sits at the top of a hill surrounded by woodland
and slopes on one side down through the&nbsp;parking field
to&nbsp;the lake approximately 500m away. The other side of the
"House" is the "roundabout" which is the start and finish of all
the events. Also it is the&nbsp;lap counting&nbsp; point and it
is&nbsp;where the support crews congregate, so it is a hub of
activity as there is always someone coming through&nbsp; completing
either a lap or finishing and of course starting, just&nbsp;amazing
support for everyone taking part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were some world class endurance&nbsp;athletes taking part
so the place was buzzing! Later that evening I registered, I was
going to be in Wave 1 starting at 08.30hrs and my race number was
148. It was then time for dinner, which was pretty good and plenty
of it! No sooner had I finished dinner and it was time for the race
briefing which was very informative.</p>

<p>I racked my bike in the&nbsp;allotted tennis court adjacent to
the "roundabout"&nbsp;. Next it was&nbsp;time to&nbsp;get my kit
sorted ready for the morning. Bedtime at last but could I sleep!!!
Within&nbsp;two hours I was wide awake thinking about tomorrows
event!! The rest of the night went the same way a couple of hours
sleep then awake!!! After a fitful night I got up at 05.00hrs as I
had to go for the bike/helmet check and I passed that with flying
colours!!!! Filled up my water bottles next&nbsp;and laid out my
kit in the change tent&nbsp;which was optional or you could put
it&nbsp;by your bike. I chose the tent option as there was more
room to change etc. and as I knew I wasn't going to win there would
be no rush at T1 !!!!</p>

<p>I stood at the roundabout for awhile and just watched and soaked
up the vibes. I got chatting to some guy and he told me I could
leave my running shoes by his support crew tent which he said would
save me a little time at T2. as we had been told at the briefing
that as you completed your bike leg someone would take your bike
from you and rack it so if you wanted you could leave your run
shoes somewhere near the "roundabout". Great I thought every second
counts!! But I was to regret this move later!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next was breakfast, bloody hell no porridge!!! &nbsp;Oh well
cornflakes would do and by now the nerves were kicking in so I
wasn't that hungry!! Soon it was time to put on the penguin suit
and waddle down to the lake!!! We had been told to take an old pair
of trainers and leave by the swim exit as there were some stoney
sections to overcome enroute to T1. The water temperature was not
bad so I got in and had&nbsp; a little paddle around to ease the
nerves!</p>

<p>It was&nbsp;08.30 hrs and we were off!&nbsp; The swim was
7&nbsp;&nbsp;laps&nbsp;anticlockwise round the small lake and after
each lap you sort of pulled into a layby and called out your
number! Like playing bingo!!! I have never swam laps before in a
race so that seemed a little weird but at least I didn't get giddy
going round!!! The next thing I know it was my last lap and I was
approaching the exit ramp and I wasn't the last either as there
were two others still in the water!! No they weren't ducks they
were competitors!!!! Makes a change not to be last out the water I
thought!!![ there was only 24 in my wave!!] and there was only a
total of 48 competing in the Half.</p>

<p>Now it was a 500m run up the hill&nbsp;through the middle of the
car park field to T1&nbsp; pulling my wet suit down to my waist as
I ran, well jogged!!! As the weather was looking good I had already
decided to just wear my tri suit for the bike and run. So it was
off with the wet suit, on with the bike shoes, a few metres jog to
the bike rack and another little walk up a few steps and it was
onto the "roundabout" for the start of the 5&nbsp;bike laps. The
course was undulating and at times went through the New Forest
National Park, that was strange taking part in a triathlon and
having to avoid horses, ponies and cows in the road!!! They look at
you like they own the place!!!! At least I didn't hit one!!</p>

<p>There was a bit of a drag up Braggers Lane towards the end of
each lap before re-entering the grounds of Avon Tyrrell House, then
it levelled out before a very short fast descent to the
"roundabout". Call out your number as you went over the timing mat
and it was back out on the next lap. No mishaps on the bike and
soon it was the end of the last lap and back onto the "roundabout"
for T2.</p>

<p>As I dismounted I was told I had to rack my own bike back on the
tennis court!!! So much for my hidden shoes for a fast getaway!! Of
course I had already taken my feet out of my bike shoes before
dismounting so I had to jog to the bike rack across tarmac and
stoney ground and then back again to get my running shoes on!!! The
plans of mice and men eh!!! At least I remembered to rub the grit
off the bottom of my socks before setting off on the first of 12
laps.</p>

<p>The first two laps I felt pretty good and was running fairly
strong for me! The course was all off road,&nbsp;very technical
with&nbsp;tree roots [which had been marked with orange paint] and
there were two spots where it was quite muddy and wet. It was a
tough run route and each lap got harder, the sun got
hotter&nbsp;and I got slower. As you entered the "roundabout" at
the end of each lap you called out your race number as you went
over the timing mat and the crowds were cheering and clapping which
was a great feeling and certainly helped me push through the
pain!</p>

<p>After six laps I had that feeling, you know what it's like, this
is bloody hard and am I going to finish!! But you just dig in deep
and carry on. At the end of the ninth lap I knew I had got it
cracked as there were only two normal laps to do then the last
lap&nbsp;you do a&nbsp;U turn over the timing mat and run the last
lap in reverse so that everyone watching and racing knows you are
about to finish your challenge. Oh my god what a fantastic feeling
as you run round and the crowds&nbsp;cheer and clap and those
runners&nbsp;going in the opposite direction high five you and
clap!! I had a few lumps in my throat! Then it was up the last hill
and down onto the by now&nbsp;infamous "roundabout" to the cheering
crowds and the FINISH!!</p>

<p>Bloody hell that was TOUGH!! Will I do it again? Maybe, might
even try the SINGLE!! What am I saying!!!!</p>

<p>Results:</p>

<p>swim&nbsp; 1.3 miles&nbsp;&nbsp; 51mins 9 secs a PB for
me!&nbsp;&nbsp; 22nd out of 24</p>

<p>

<p>I know it's been a long race report and probably boring but I
just wanted to give everyone a feeling for the atmosphere and the
race setup. Also I was so pleased with my overall time that I just
wanted to share it with you all. Thank you all for your
support.</p>

<p style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="text">Thursday session is
approximately a 50 min run. The session is interval training so no
one is left on their own. We leave the Dolphin at 19:30 with a slow
jog to the starting point,&nbsp;the session is then started and you
work at your own pace, we then all jog back as a group. Club
coaches take it in turn to deliver the session.</p>

<h2 class="text">Club Yoga Sessions</h2>

<p>S<strong>tarting on Tuesday 29th October 2013 and finishing 3rd
December 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A series of six sessions that encourages the mind to focus and
allows you to explore in more detail the function of the body. As
triathletes training and racing is demanding, the yoga helps to
keep the muscles long and supple and lowers the risk of injury.
Spending time stretching and focusing on key areas will help you
gain more flexibility, strength and balance. The sessions are open
to all, so if you are new to yoga give it a try, if you have
already had experience of yoga it is an opportunity to develop your
practice.<br />
<br />
 Sessions are 45mins long starting at 7pm upstairs in the
<strong>Old Ardinian Room which is part of the cricket pavilion at
Ardingly</strong>. I aim to finish in enough time so you can be in
the pool at 8pm for the swim! Please wear loose clothing and bring
a yoga mat and a blanket. £4 a session.</p>

<h2 class="text">Club Swim Sessions</h2>

 Thursdays swim is a 1 hour coached swim session in the pool at the
Dolphin Leisure Centre, Haywards Heath. A session based purely on
improving overall swim technique and efficiency. Coaching by our
team of club coaches. We have 3 lanes booked from 20:30 until 21:30
for club use.</p>

<p style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="text"><br />

available (code is C23469)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px; margin: 6px 0px;" class="text">We
share this venue with a few tri clubs so if you decide to come
along you will see everyone getting changed on the floating jetty
so come along and introduce yourself. Clubs have specific swim hats
- ours are red and have our logo on (available from&nbsp;Steve
Mac).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px; margin: 6px 0px;" class="text">There
is a code of conduct point which states swimmers should swim up the
left bank, and down the middle of the lake to minimise the risk of
collision, and to separate us from kayakers. When there are no
kayakers, we can be a little more lax. Also to avoid head to head
contact a bit more sighting practise and those coming out of the
sun (towards the jetty) should give way to those heading away from
the jetty.</p>

Warden Park School, Broad Street, Cuckfield, RH17 5DP

double blue doors in front of you (not the ones on the
left).&nbsp;Best to bring a bike light/torch as there is little to
no lighting in this area.</p>

<p style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="text">These sessions are free
the club pays for the hire of the hall and it is run by volunteers
(non MSTC&nbsp;members are encouraged to take part but will be
charged £2). We have a mix of leaders for the sessions so the style
tends to alternate.</p>

<p style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="text"><span class="bold">The
floor is a cushioned type so you will need to put a sheet of ply or
a strong mat under your turbo to avoid any dents. You will
<strong>NOT</strong> be allowed to take part if you do not have
sturdy floor protection to stop the Turbo's denting the cushion
floor.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="text"><span class="bold">Don't
forget to bring with you water/energy drink, towel, Heart Rate

<p><span class="bold">All laps go via the Princess Royal roundabout
and down through Northlands Wood and Lindfield.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">The objective is to have a safe fast training
ride where we all look after each other, however, everyone joins in
at their own risk. All riders start together and naturally split in
to similar ability groups. Safety is paramount on these rides and
all riders are reminded to have working lights, reflective gear and
follow the rules of the road and ride according to
conditions.</span></p>

<p><strong><span class="bold">Info:</span></strong></p>

<p style="margin: 6px 0px;" class="text">Other training sessions
are organised by groups within the club, so that individuals can
choose to concentrate on different aspects of Triathlon and fit the
training in with their work/social life.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[
I started writing this thinking it would be short and concise. some
hope. You may get board reading this so don't let that or any of
the rules put you off going on a ride there are a lot of extremely
experienced riders who don't know the half of this.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Do</strong><br />
<ol>
<li>Nominate a ride leader for each group keep an eye on the pack.
If the pack gets spread out, the leader is expected to slow the
pace.</li>

<li>Introduce yourself to the rest of the group. Agree the pace at
which you are all happy to ride</li>

<li>Remember how many people are in the group and ensure the group
stays together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<ul>
<li>Agreeing a pace is difficult, people have completely different
ideas of what they're capable of, what pace they ride at, and
particularly the difference in speed of a group.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Ride at the pace agreed in the group: these are training rides,
not races.</li>

<li>Ensure the group re-forms if split up by traffic lights or
during a climb. 

<ul>
<li>Make sure you put regular "tempo" own pace segments into the
ride - normally up longer hills, but having at least 1 or 2 on
slight descents / downhills will help keep the heavier guys
interested. On hills the group will have to split unless the
strongest guys are so prepared to sandbag that they'll ride up very
easily. Just regroup at the top of the hill before the next
junction.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Either stop at a safe point on the roadside or slow until the
group re-forms.</li>

<li>Ensure no rider is to be left behind unless they decide to
leave the group. Look out for each other as it is no fun being left
on your own, especially in winter. 

<ul>
<li>Hold an actual wheel, do not ride 10yards off the back</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Let the rest of the group know if you decide to leave the
group</li>

<li>Talk to each other. Point out either with hand signals or
shouts, all potholes, manhole covers and other dangers in the road
that could cause punctures or accidents. Follow the hand signals
and calls of the riders in front as they will have seen the danger
before you and then you can all communicate down the pack. 

<ul>
<li>Voice ones of Easy / Stopping / Clear / Car Up / Car Down / Car
Back / Hole</li>

<li>Hand signals Point at Hole / Waft at obstructions / hand
flicking behind back to the left or right / hand straight up in the
air.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>If you are the back of the group and can see someone dropping
or being dropped it is your responsibility to call to the cyclists
in front that the pace is too high. The pack must communicate this
up to the front. The lead cyclists will not be aware if you start
to drop. Ask them to slow down, it is your ride too. 

<ul>
<li>When asked to "ease up' or "slow a little" do not brake
suddenly. Gentle ease your pace by pedalling less hard or
freewheeling for a moment. Look at your speedo - if someone is
being dropped you probably only need to reduce your speed by half a
mile an hour to allow them to stay on.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Ride at a steady pace rather than surging keeping the pack as a
compact unit. It's a long steady ride not an intervals
session.</li>

<li>Carry inner tubes, tyre levers and a pump or CO2 that can get
your tyre up to road pressures also a mini tool might be useful.
Bring enough food and drink to get you all the way, even without
the tea stop</li>

<li>No more than 2 abreast. Call "single up" or similar as well as
"car back" if a car needs to pass and can't when you're in a double
line. . If a car is approach ahead on a narrow road, it may also be
appropriate to go single file, in which case shout "car up".</li>

<li>Dont ride on tri bars whilst in a group/make sure your brakes
are covered</li>

<li>When riding in a pack, look at "shoulder level" of cyclists in
front of you to allow you to see what is occurring ahead of you ?
as in further up the road than just the cyclists in front of you.
Fixing your gaze on the back tire of the person in front of you
doesn?t give you enough time to react should the entire group slow
down!</li>

<li>Ride your bike in such a manner as to not offend motorists,
pedestrians, etc. While not required, a "thank you wave" to a
motorist who yields to the pack does make friends! A "hi" to a
youngster that we pass may encourage the youngster to begin
cycling.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
 <strong>Close formation riding</strong><br />
 Riding on level ground your front wheel should be within 50cm of
the back wheel of the bike in front. This takes practice to get
comfortable with. You should also be close enough to touch the
rider next to you. Your handle bars should be level with the person
to your left/right so if you do swerve into each other your handle
bars will not interlock or get tangled in the various cables.<br />
<br />
 By riding in close formation it makes the group easier to overtake
and increases the draft benefit for the weaker riders in the
group.<br />
<br />
 On downhills you may prefer to leave a bigger gap to the bike in
front and when going uphill beware of moving from a seated position
to standing out of the saddle, this action results in pushing your
bike backwards into the rider behind, so try to be aware of riders
around you.<br />
<br />
 Ride in order to keep the group together. If you are on the front,
don't accelerate hard out of junctions or over the tops of hills
because you'll stretch out the group like a rubber band and the
effort to close gaps will slowly exhaust the weaker riders. If you
are in the pack, close the gaps quickly when they open. This may
mean having to work hard for a short period - this is how you pay
back those doing the hard work up front! Do not be offended when
another rider tells you to close a gap, and if you don't feel able
to do so then tell others so they can move up into your
place.<br />
<br />
 Occasionally the ride leader may want to inject and interval or
slightly faster section into the training ride, in which case he
will let riders know (e.g. from here to the next village I want
everyone to put in a hard effort). This may mean that riders may
spread out to the pace they are capable. The idea however is not to
give up if you can't keep up with the rider in front but to
continue your effort at your ability until you reach a designated
point. All riders will wait after a faster section to
re-group.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <strong>Don't</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>DON'T ride off the front. This is a group ride, not a race. If
you want to go faster then let the others know what you are going
to do and if no one wants to join you then go off and enjoy your
ride alone. 

<ul>
<li>Unless of course there's a village sign up ahead, then sprint
for it for all your worth...</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>DON'T overlap wheels - riders should follow the wheel in front
but not let their front wheel overlap the back wheel of the rider
in front, it is the most common cause of a crash in a group. (if
the rider in front needs to avoid an obstacle then he could swerve
into your wheel if it is overlapping theirs). Instead, keep your
front wheel behind and in line with the wheel of the rider in
front.</li>

<li>DON'T make sudden movements - braking suddenly or altering your
course unannounced will create havoc for the riders behind
you.</li>

<li>DON'T undertake a rider (pass them on their left hand side). In
the exceptional case that you have to make sure you let the rider
know by saying "rider on inside" or "rider on left".</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
 <strong>Other essential rules &amp; skills</strong><br />
 You have to be able to take one hand off the bars to drink, to
signal and to look at the road behind you.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Have respect for other road users</strong><br />
 In country lanes and heavy traffic, cars may find it difficult to
pass. So the shout of "single file" will go up and the riders on
the right will file in behind the rider to their left until the
cars are past and it is safe to ride two by two again.
Occasionally, it may even be necessary to pull over to let a queue
of traffic past - yes, the highway code doesn't require it but it
is the decent thing to do.<br />
<br />
 Slow down for horses and pass as wide as possible. A call (not
shout!) of "Bike coming" or simply "Good morrow to you, beast
mistress" will allow horse and rider to anticipate your sudden
appearance.<br />
<br />
 Be aware of the people around you and that your movements will
affect the entire group. For example, if you get out of the saddle
on a climb, your back wheel will typically drop back six inches.
Pedal continuously at a pace and cadence consistent with the riders
ahead, and when it's your turn on the front try to maintain the
pace of the group. It takes time to get used to but consistent
riding is vital.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Listen, ask and be honest</strong><br />
 Talk to people and take on board what they tell you. Don't be
afraid to ask questions - everyone was a novice once. If you've any
doubts about your fitness or handling skills, always opt for a
slower group.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Ride close</strong><br />
 You'll only get the slipstream effect if you're tucked right in
behind the rider in front. Leave too big a gap and you're
short-changing yourself and the riders behind you. If you're
nervous about clipping the wheel in front, ride six inches either
side of it but take care not to overlap. Don't spend the whole time
staring at the rear tyre of the rider ahead - you must look up
every now and then.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Be prepared</strong><br />
 Ensure your bike is well maintained and that you have a multitool,
pump, tyre levers and spare inner tubes. Make sure you've enough
food and drink for the length of ride planned and suitable clothing
for any changes of weather. Also, if you don't know the area, carry
a map - 99.9% of clubs have a policy of not abandoning people but
if you lose the group for whatever reason, you should be able to
find your own way home.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Don't be 'grabby' on your brakes</strong><br />
 A good group rider will barely need to touch their brakes and
hopefully those ahead will be the same. Changes of speed, either
braking or speeding up, should be gradual.<br />
 If the road ahead looks clear, ride with your hands on the
tops.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Don't Half wheel</strong><br />
 If road conditions and traffic allows, you'll generally be riding
two abreast. Maintain an even pace and stay level with the person
next to you. Don't constantly up the pace whenever a rider draws
level to you. This is very bad form and is guaranteed to draw lots
of disapproving looks and comments.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Don't</strong> <strong>Wheel suck</strong><br />
 Don't always sit among the wheels and shirk your stint on the
front. Even if you just put in a few turns of the pedals it'll be
noted and appreciated. But, even if you're finding the pace easy,
don't get on the front and put the hammer down. Chances are you'll
look back to find nobody has followed you and you'll hear mirth
about the "typical triathlete".<br />
<br />
<br />
 If the ride is meant to leave at 8:30 then make sure you are there
before so the ride can leave on time. Some people have to be back
for family commitments and it's a bit annoying having ride time
eaten away by people being late.<br />
<br />
 Fit mudguards, especially in winter or if the weather is bad. It's
unpleasant riding behind people without mudguards if it's wet and
all the shit is flying up off their back wheel in to your face.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>If you catch the person in front of you and wish to overtake
then the overtaking swimmer should gently but distinctly touch the
feet of the swimmer being overtaken.&nbsp; It may take two or three
touches, but overtaking swimmers should not need to repeatedly slap
or grab at the legs of a slower swimmer to politely make their
presence known.</p>

<p>A lead swimmer who feels a touch on the feet from an overtaking
swimmer, should continue to the next wall, then stop in the corner
of the lane to let faster swimmers past.&nbsp; A single light touch
may be accidental and can be ignored, but two or more distinct
touches should be regarded almost universally as a request to swim
through.</p>

<p>Swimmers enjoying a draft behind a strong lead swimmer, but who
are just barely able to hold that pace should think twice before
tagging the leader's toes and requesting to move ahead.&nbsp; In
such situations, it's highly unlikely that the (formerly) trailing
swimmer will be able to hold the same pace for very long when
leading without the draft.&nbsp; This can lead to repeated
"leap-fogging" and unnecessary contact, which can be annoying and
disruptive for everyone in the lane.</p>

<p>Drafting swimmers not wishing to pass should swim far enough
back from a lead swimmer that they don't inadvertently touch the
lead swimmer's toes.</p>

<p>If resting or starting do not push off in front of an
approaching swimmer unless you are sure you are faster and they
will not catch you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Top ten tips to a fast swim Transition:</strong><br />
 1. Kick hard for 50 metres before you stand up to get the blood
into the legs and stop that light headed feeling = more
co-ordination, faster transition.<br />
 2. Swim as far into the bank before standing up.<br />
 3. Get water into the suit before you stand so it buoys the
wetsuit from the skin as it runs though. The suit will then fall
off if you follow procedure below.<br />
 4. Put your goggles onto your forehead and leave them until the
wetsuit is off.<br />
 5. Left hand behind the neck open the velcro and don't let
go.<br />
 6. Right hand behind the back pull the zip cord all the way in one
go.<br />
 7. Left hand pulls the suit just over the shoulder then goes to
the right side.<br />
 8. Left hand pulls the right side down and in one go it rolls off
the arm.<br />
 9. Do all this while you steadily move to your shoes.<br />
 10. At your transition point execute the Kick &amp; Flick to get
the suit of over your feet.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
 <span class="standard-text"><strong>Why the suit gets
stuck:</strong></span><br />
 a) The flap behind the zip is twisted.<br />
 b) You didn't pull the zip tight as you pull the strap down.<br />
 c) You let go of the neck velcro too soon.<br />
 d) Don't bend the elbow when you roll the suit off the arms.<br />
 e) keep moving forward out of the water. If you stop you may feel
dizzy and fall over!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Don't start at the back!</strong></p>

<p>The 'bun' fight as we like to call it comes from individuals
desire to get away quickly and in most cases away from the
masses.</p>

<p>No one is ever trying to grab or kick you on purpose, they are
all very nervous and thinking exactly the same as you. It can be
very difficult to avoid bumping into people. One of the things that
people tell me is that they will start at the back to avoid
this.</p>

<p>The trouble is everyone is trying to do the same thing so you
can imagine 100+ triathletes there as the gun goes waiting for
everyone else to go first.&nbsp; "after you" "no after you" "no you
first"..&nbsp;So&nbsp;'don't start at the back'.</p>

<p>Look for the racing line to the first buoy. This is the shortest
route. Then look at where most people are bunched up at the start.
Go to the side of these people but not at the back.</p>

<p>Just before the gun goes get into what we call a 'deep water
start position' This is as horizontal in the water as possible. Use
the buoyancy of the wetsuit to help you do this. So when the gun
goes your legs are already up and you can start immediately. Swim
hard but not too hard, you don't want to go anaerobic.</p>

<p>You need to sustain a fast pace for 50&gt;100 meters giving time
for people to find their line and space out. Swim with a real
economy of effort directly behind the person in fronts feet. Try
not to hit their feet though. Breathe every two strokes to ensure
you get enough oxygen
in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Most running experts agree that it's impossible to run a
successful marathon without completing some long training runs
first. But how long is long? American runners typically aim for 20
miles. Runners on the metric system, however, often peak at 30
kilometers, which is only 18.6 miles. And Keith and Kevin Hanson,
coaches of the Hansons-Brooks Distance Project, design marathon
training plans for most of the sub-elite runners they coach that
regularly culminate in a mere 16-miler-and by all reports they work
quite well.</p>

<p>In short, there is no definitive minimum distance that every
runner must cover in training before running a marathon. While few
runners have the talent to get away with never running more than 13
miles (the longest distance Grete Waitz ran prior to winning the
1978 New York City Marathon) in their marathon preparation, your
longest run might not need to be quite as long as you think.</p>

<p>Why? Because, according to some experts, you can largely
duplicate the benefits of doing a handful of long runs (think 16-20
miles) by doing a greater number of moderately long runs (think
10-14 miles), some of them at higher intensities. Your best
results, however, might come from doing a mix of conventional long
runs and long-run alternatives such as the three described
below.</p>

<p>"During a marathon build-up, all runners, regardless of ability
level, should assure themselves of being able to comfortably run at
least 16 miles," says Kevin Beck, a Boulder-based running coach and
editor of Run Strong (Human Kinetics). "That said, there are a
number of ways in which shorter long runs may be particularly
beneficial."</p>

<p><strong>The Glycogen Factor</strong><br />
 One benefit of substituting some long runs with moderately long
runs is that it enables you to increase your total training mileage
without risking injury or overtraining. According to Beck, total
weekly mileage is more important than the distance of the long run
in marathon training. For example, a program that maxes out with a
70-mile week and a 17-mile long run is likely to render you fitter
than a program that does so with a 50-mile week and a 22-mile long
run.</p>

<p>The reason has to do with muscle glycogen, the precious fuel
whose conservation is vital to marathon success. "The sheer amount
of glycogen turnover inherent in high-mileage programs stimulates
some of the same physiological adaptations as do long runs," says
Beck. That's because most of the endurance-boosting benefits of a
long run come toward the end, when your muscle glycogen stores are
running low. But when you frequently run moderate to moderately
long distances, you often start workouts with a half-empty
tank.</p>

<p>Another way to get the benefits of 16- to 20-mile runs from 10-
to 14-mile runs is to crank up the intensity of those shorter
workouts. You can burn as much glycogen in a 90-minute fast run as
you can in a two-plus-hour slow run, so you get a similar benefit.
Beck recommends running 30 to 50 percent of the mileage in your
moderately long runs at your goal marathon pace. You can also
increase the intensity of these runs by running on hills instead of
speeding up.</p>

<p><strong>Up and Down</strong><br />
 Run 10 to 14 miles on the hilliest route in your area. Try to keep
your average pace close to your goal marathon pace despite the
topography. This workout will not only use as much glycogen as a
longer run on flat terrain, but thanks to the downhill portions it
will also subject your legs to as much pounding as a longer run,
toughening them up for race day.</p>

<p><strong>90-Minute Blast</strong><br />
 Warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of easy jogging and then run for 90
minutes at 95 percent effort. So if the farthest you could run in
90 minutes is 10 miles, run about 9.5 miles in your 90-Minute
Blast. You will burn as much glycogen as you would in a
two-plus-hour run at a moderate pace.</p>

<p><strong>Divided Long Run</strong><br />
 Instead of doing a long run on Saturday and taking Sunday off (or
vice versa), do moderately long runs on both days. For example,
instead of running 20 miles on Saturday and zero on Sunday, run 12
miles on Saturday and 12 again the next morning. The combined
benefit of your Divided Long Run will be at least as great as that
of the single longer run.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>In training, you have a choice. Everyone agrees that triathletes
need to run after some bike rides by way of preparing to do the
same in races, but there's also a consensus that it's not necessary
to run after every ride. So what's the sweet spot? How regularly
should you follow a ride with an immediate run?</p>

<p>According to the top coaches, it depends. Among the factors to
consider in planning this aspect of your training are your
experience level, your schedule, your susceptibility to injury and
how your body responds to this type of training.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of bike-run workouts you can do. A
"brick" consists of a full bike workout followed immediately by a
full run workout. A transition run is a short run after a full bike
ride. Whereas bricks prepare the athlete more comprehensively for
the race experience, transition runs are more narrowly focused on
preparing the athlete for the transition from riding to
running.</p>

<p>Because they are more stressful and time-consuming, bricks
cannot be done as often as transition runs. According to coach
Cliff English, whether you do occasional bricks or more frequent
transition runs should depend on the distance of your races. "The
long-course athletes I coach usually do one brick per week," he
says. "Short-course athletes do multiple short transition
runs."</p>

<p>A second factor to consider is your level of experience in the
sport. "The newer the athlete is to triathlon, the more valuable
transition runs can be to get them used to running off the bike,"
says Tim Crowley, a coach whose athletes include Olympian Jarrod
Shoemaker. As a beginner you will probably notice that transition
runs yield big improvements in your ability to run off the bike. As
you gain experience, you might find that you become less dependent
on transition runs to maintain the ability to run well after
pedaling, and as that happens, you can reduce the frequency.</p>

<p>Some triathletes perform frequent transition runs - as often as
after every bike ride - not because they need to, but simply to
save time.</p>

<p>"Training in three sports and getting reasonable frequency is a
challenge, so this is a time-efficient way to maintain run
frequency," says coach Lance Watson.</p>

<p>Another potential benefit of frequent transition runs is injury
prevention. According to coach Matt Dixon, "Adding short runs off
the bike is a great way to increase frequency without overloading
the athlete from a musculoskeletal standpoint."</p>

<p>While frequent transition runs may help you fit it all in and
avoid injury, coaches caution against depending on them. "It's
important to run on fresh legs sometimes," says Crowley.</p>

<p>While there's no magic number for frequency of post-ride runs, a
few basic considerations will help you settle on a number that
works best for you.</p>

        <featureTitle>Transition Workouts: When to Run After a Ride</featureTitle>

In triathlon, there's no choice: You have to run (or at least walk)
after riding your bike to reach the finish line. No run, no
finisher's medal.

        <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>While running, you usually have one foot in contact with the
ground, providing one less degree of freedom than swimming.
Cycling, on the other hand, allows constant contact with the
saddle, both hands and both feet, accounting for five fewer degrees
of freedom than swimming. In swimming, there are really no solid
contact points and plenty of opportunities to create your own
problems.</p>

<p>Pool swimmers can be very graceful and fast, but may have
difficulty translating this in-pool speed to the open water.</p>

<p>It is the front-end focused swimmers, with a long glide, strong
catch and low turnover/cadence, who are most efficient in calm,
smooth, non-crowded waters. However, this group is often out swum
in the open water by the high turnover crowd as they thrash through
the waves with a strong back end to their stroke.</p>

<p>One of the most frustrating challenges for swimmers with poor
mechanics is that they may spend countless hours in the pool,
swimming hard, but fail to make any significant progress in their
open water swim speed. This equates to a misappropriation of the
athlete's "stress budget", because a good deal of stress is
utilized with little or no return on the investment.</p>

<p><strong>Problems and Solutions</strong><br />
Swimmers have a variety of common problems with their mechanics,
including poor balance, missed catch and low cadence.&nbsp; Here
are some swim drills to identify stroke mechanics that may be handy
when underwater video analysis is not readily available.</p>

<p><strong>Golf</strong></p>

<p>Use this as a metric to measure streamlining and body balance.
The golf test is performed by swimming 50-yards and recording your
time, in seconds, and the total number of strokes it takes. Take
the sum of these two numbers and that is your score.</p>

<p>Like the sport of golf, the lower the score, the better. A score
that is above 65, for taller athletes, and 75, for shorter
athletes, is typically indicative of the need for work with balance
drill sets to improve streamlining.</p>

<p><strong>100 No Kick, 50 Kick</strong></p>

<p>This test helps identify propulsive needs. Swim a 100-yard time
trial (TT) without kicking at all, followed by a 50-yard TT using a
kick board. Then divide your time for the 100 yards by your time
for the 50 yards.</p>

<p>If this score is outside of the 1.50 to 1.70 range, then you
should either be working more on your kick propulsion or your upper
body propulsion (i.e. arm position, catch, pull, follow-through). A
ratio that is greater than 1.7 is indicative of relatively weak
upper body propulsion. A ratio that is lower than 1.5 may point
towards a weaker kick.</p>

<p><strong>The TI (Total Immersion) Family of Swim
Drills</strong><br />
This series of swim drills mainly addresses balance and
streamlining issues. But, once you fix your balance issues, avoid
these drills because they tend to slow swim cadence and increase
front end glide.</p>

<p><strong>Fist/Free</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Poor balance, straight arm recovery, cross-over
and/or disconnected shoulders and hips.</p>

<p>Swim 100-yards, the first 50-yards with closed fists, and the
second 50-yards with open hands. This helps to improve the catch
phase of your stroke, by making you very conscious of your arm and
hand positions, following the fist lengths.</p>

<p><strong>Aerobic Paddles</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Missed catch.</p>

<p>This helps to improve swimming-specific strength and the catch
phase. Using paddles in an aerobic manner, similar to the 50
fist/50 free drill, forces you to become more aware of your hand
positions, through the entirety of your stroke.</p>

<p><strong>Ankle Bands</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Missed catch, weak back end, and/or strength
limiters.</p>

<p>Ankle bands shut off a swimmer's kick, forcing them to balance
their body in order to create a more productive forward pull.
Forward velocity helps create balance and is a function of good
mechanics. This swim drill is very effective for most triathletes,
as it addresses almost all common deficiencies.</p>

<p><strong>Tabatas</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Any of the above issues.</p>

<p>Tabata intervals are a great tool for improving turnover. Do
these once or twice each week by sprinting 25 yards while focusing
on high stroke turnover, followed by a 10-second rest, and repeat
eight to 10 times. Do two sets with two minutes rest in
between.</p>

<p><strong>Single Arm Swimming</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Poor timing and/or low swim cadence.</p>

<p>Single arm swimming is the number one way to connect a swimmer's
hips to their shoulders. With one arm out in front, stroke with the
other arm. Once you master this, hold the arm that is not stroking
at your side.</p>

<p><strong>Swim Cords</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Disconnected shoulders and hips.</p>

<p>Swim cord routines are an excellent way for swimmers to help
ingrain good arm position and the elusive high elbow. It is always
easier to work on these items with the consistency of dry land,
than in the multi-variable environment of the water. Swim cords
also help to target potential strength limiters in swimmers with
relatively low body mass index (BMI).</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive Thinking</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Missed catch, weak back end, strength limiters.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, cognitive thought can address all of the
above issues. All of the drill work in the world is useless if you
are not thinking about your swim mechanics with each and every
stroke. For example, thinking "fingers tips down, wrist aligned"
early in your swim stroke can help to create a higher elbow and
faster cadence.</p>

<p><strong>Vertical Kicking and Fin Work</strong></p>

<p>If you have: Poor kick.</p>

<p>For those with very poor kicking ability, vertical kicking in
the deep end for 1-minute sets is a great way to generate more kick
propulsion from the hips. Do this with a kickboard in your hands,
slowly moving it above your head as you progress.</p>

<p>Once you can do three sets of one minute with the board above
your head, move onto swimming with the fins, which helps you feel
your kick more effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Pull Buoy Swimming</strong></p>

<p>If you have: A 100 No Kick, 50 Kick ratio that is below the 1.50
threshold</p>

<p>Focused aerobic pull buoy swimming is a great way to shut off
the kick and allow you to focus on many of the upper-body related
limiters identified above. This is especially beneficial for any
identifiable body rotation limiters.</p>

<p><strong>For Any Issue Other than Poor Balance</strong></p>

<p>If you are looking for an efficient and comfortable way to swim
while training and racing, focus on the front end, a low stroke
count and long glide. If you want to lead the swim portion of a
triathlon, focus on a strong back end and high turnover, both of
which still require good balance in the water.</p>

<p>Different swimming objectives require different training
techniques and mechanical demands. So, when receiving swim drill
advice or looking for a coach, make sure that you clarify the type
of racing that you are looking to do, and make sure that the advice
matches your specific objectives.</p>

        <featureText><![CDATA[
Of the three disciplines in triathlon, swimming is the most
difficult and critical to master. Swimming has many degrees of
freedom, as compared to running and cycling, because of a lack of
sturdy connections to firm ground. As an activity's degrees of
freedom increase, so too does the difficulty to master its
mechanics.<br />

        <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><strong>How Much Do You Need Per Session?</strong></p>

<p>How many carbs you can ingest is limited by the rate of
absorption from the intestines into the bloodstream. Peak rates
from a single carbohydrate (i.e. glucose) appear to be around 1.2
grams per minute.</p>

<p>However, when different types of carbohydrates are combined -
most commonly glucose and fructose - the rate can increase to about
1.75 grams per minute, almost a 50 percent increase. This is
because fructose and glucose use different transporters that absorb
faster into the bloodstream, delivering energy to your muscles
quicker.</p>

<p>Consuming a mixed carbohydrate sports drink or gel rather than a
glucose-only drink allows you to use carbohydrate at a faster rate,
and the sugar blend reduces feelings of stomach discomfort. Most
sports products will use a mix of carbohydrate sources.</p>

<p>How many carbs you should take in per hour is influenced by
exercise intensity and duration, carbohydrate availability, your
fitness level and environmental conditions. Here are my carb intake
recommendations for specific workouts or races.</p>

<p><strong>Sprint races and short workouts</strong><br />
You need: A swig of a sports drink</p>

<p>Your muscles and liver have enough stored glycogen for short
efforts, so additional carbohydrate is usually unnecessary.
However, research has shown that a sports drink can still be
beneficial. Studies of athletes who exercise for 60 minutes have
found improved performance when they take in carbohydrate, despite
having adequate body stores. Even just rinsing your mouth with a
carbohydrate-containing fluid (such as a sports drink) can enhance
performance. Although the explanation for this improved performance
is unclear, it seems that a small amount of carbohydrate may
enhance exercise performance simply by stimulating the brain!</p>

<p><strong>Workouts &gt; 90 minutes</strong><br />
You need: 30-60 grams per hour, single or mixed carbs</p>

<p>This is the point when muscle glycogen stores are stressed and
you need to take in additional carbohydrate to maintain
blood-glucose levels and provide fuel for working muscles. How much
carbohydrate you need depends on many factors (pre-carbo-loading,
fitness, body size, etc.) and can range from 30-60 grams per hour.
Because you are not trying to absorb as much energy as you can, a
mixed carbohydrate sugar source is not as vital.</p>

<p><strong>Half- or full-iron-distance races</strong><br />
You need: 80-100 grams per hour (males), 60-90 grams (females),
mixed carbs</p>

<p>In Ironman races, where carbohydrate is an important fuel for
the working muscles, think about consuming as much as you can
(sensibly) or as tolerated without causing GI problems. The bike
during an iron-distance race could be considered a - racing
smorgasbord - tolerance, opportunity to eat and availability of
food and fluids are high compared to the swim and run. Males should
aim to consume 80-100 grams of carbohydrate per hour from mixed
carbohydrate sources (more than one type of sugar) throughout the
ride. For females, 60-90 grams is a reasonable hourly target.</p>

<p>"My love of sports and the variety available really started at
University when I discovered the joys of kayaking and from then
just had a go at everything: ladies rugby, badminton, windsurfing,
sailing, triathlons and even managed to play in volleyball and
squash leagues. This led me to having a desire to understand the
human physiology in relation to fitness and strength training, so I
qualified as a Personal Trainer in 2010 and worked part-time in

some of the knowledge and experience I've gained to help others get
the most out of multi-sports.</p>

<p>Why am I interested in coaching? There's the theory that it
takes 10,000 hours of work to become an elite-level athlete, well
not many of us can put in 10,000 hours, so my aim is to help
athletes get the most out of the hours that they do have by
demystifying some of the principles &amp; techniques so that they
can get be the best they can."</p>

<h2>Mark Jordan</h2>

<div>
<p>"I have been involved in triathlon for 5 years now. I started
because I had allowed myself to get into a middle-aged rut and
needed something challenging to get me fit. I have thoroughly
enjoyed the process, albeit that I still struggle with running
speed. &nbsp;I am lucky enough to be&nbsp;a Great Britain Age-Group
athlete at standard and long distance.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>I came into coaching because I wanted to give something back to
the sport and because it is a great way to learn and
develop.&nbsp;My main area of interest as a coach is swimming and
especially technique based work.&nbsp;That said, I am really
interested in fitness and conditioning. &nbsp;I am also involved
with the junior section and tend there to act as as a general
coach, across the 3 main disciplines."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Dale Moore</h2>

<div>
<p>"I was a physical training instructor with the Territorial Army
for two years, I then completed a five week physical training
course for the Metropolitan Police Service. My main expertise was
in teaching self-defence and circuit training.</p>

<div>
<p>I have over 25 years experience in Martial arts. Gaining a 5th
degree black belt in Ju Jitsu, a 3rd degree black belt in Aikido, a
2nd dan black belt in free style karate and finally a brown belt
1st kyu in Judo.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>I am a current world record holder for the most judo throws in
an hour, and have held this title since 2002. I won a silver in the
Southern Area championships at Crystal Palace</p>

<div>
<p>I have competed in the Police National Judo championships,
winning bronze in the heavy weight section, and a silver in the
U95Kg section. I reached the quarter finals of the national Ju
Jitsu championships in Birmingham.</p>

<p>I love all aspects of training and believe in working the whole
body. I especially enjoy circuit training as it strengthens the
whole body. I would like to give my coaching experience to those
who feel they would benefit from this type of training. I believe
circuit training has a necessary part to play in triathlon
training."</p>

<h2>Tevor Moore</h2>

<p><span>"I took up triathlon 5 years ago, just prior to joining
MSTC. Before that I didn't have much sporting background apart from
3 years of Lacrosse playing for Southampton University. I've self
coached myself from Novice triathlons all the way up to 70.3 and I
still have a full Ironman in my sights.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I am now a qualified triathlon coach and the Club Head Run
Coach. I'm also a qualified bicycle mechanic which comes in
handy!</span></p>

<p><span>I believe with hard work, a good training schedule , self
belief and determination anyone can complete a
triathlon."</span><br />

<h2>Want to join our Coaching Team?</h2>

<p>We are always looking for members to become coaches. &nbsp;We
offer the opportunity for our coaches to be trained, initially to
level 1 with the BTF before progressing through level 2 and,
possibly, to level 3. &nbsp;We are keen also to train our coaches
to the various levels and to put them through specific skills short
courses offered by the Amateur Swimming Association, British
Cycling, and England Athletics and other relevant bodies. &nbsp;A
number of coaches are also trained in the likes of spinning and
fitness training.</p>

<p>In return for funding the coaching courses, we ask that coaches
make themselves available for inclusion in the coaching register.
&nbsp;This means a commitment of something like at least two
session per month for a period of at least a year. &nbsp;That said,
coaching duties are allocated after discussions with the head
coach, David Jones, and we are flexible with how coaching hours are
accumulated. &nbsp;David runs regular coaches meetings. &nbsp;These
are fairly relaxed and very supportive.</p>

<p>As a small token of thanks for the efforts of our coaches, the
club forgoes the payment of swim fees for those who are active
coaches.</p>

<p>The Mid Sussex Tri Club is holding a special training swim at
the Ardingly Reservoir on Saturday 2nd August in aid of the Laurens
Silver Swimmer Charity.</p>

<p>The charity is a local charity that seeks to provide money for
children with life long disability who require aquatic therapy. The
charity commemorates the life of a wonderful little girl who loved
swimming in her all too short life.</p>

<p>This is a closed event with a maximum of 50 swimmers allowed in
any of the three distances. Initially, the swim is open only to
members of the Mid Sussex and East Grinstead Triathlon Clubs,
although invited guests will be allowed to swim if there are spaces
available. Members who wish to invite a guest (or guests) should
contact <a href="mailto:mcrecord@hotmail.com">Matt
Record</a>&nbsp;or <a href="mailto:emaj1@mac.com">Mark Jordan</a>.
Members should book their entry as early as possible to allow a
decision to be made about the number of guests who can swim.
Entries for guests will be made from Monday 9th June.</p>

<h2>Distances</h2>

<ul>
<li>5 km (5 laps), Starting at 14:00</li>

<li>3 km (3 laps), Starting at 16:15</li>

<li>1 km (1 laps), Starting at 17:45</li>
</ul>

<h2>Volunteers</h2>

<p>We really need some volunteers to help us run this event.
Without your help the event will simply not be able to take place
so please offer a few hours of your time if at all possible. We
currently needs volunteers for for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canoeists (x5)</li>

<li>Land based spotters (x3)</li>

<li>Feed Marshal (x1)</li>

<li>Swimmer counters (x2)</li>

<li>Registration (x2)</li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome people who are willing to help out for a specific
period rather than for the whole afternoon, even those who are
perhaps hoping to do one of the sessions, helping out with one or
both of the others or friends or family coming along to help out as
well as support. Full briefings will be given to all who help out.
Please <a href="mailto:emaj1@mac.com">email Mark Jordan</a> if you
can be of any help</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>The safety co-ordinator and marshal for the session is Matt
Record. His decision on any matter is final.</p>

<p>A safety boat, together with a number of canoes will be on the
water in and around the swim course, together with land-based
spotters/counters. The normal safety rules for swimming at the
reservoir apply. These are set out in club's <a
href="/media/32010/Ardingly%20Reservoir%20-%20MSTC%20Club%20Policy.docx">
Open water Swimming Policy for Ardingly Reservoir</a>. Please make
sure that you have read this policy, together with the <a
href="/media/31998/5%203%201%20MSTC%20Ardingly%20Reservoir%20Risk%20Assessment.docx">
risk assessment for the session</a> and the <a
href="/media/32016/MSTC%20EAP%20-%20Swimming.docx">emergency action
plan</a>. Note that suitable wetsuits are compulsory. Swim caps
will be issued at registration. The water temperature will be
measured just prior to the session to ensure that it is within the
temperature guidance set by the BTF and the ASA about open water
swimming.</p>

<p>All members/participants are encouraged to be members of one of
the home triathlon associations and/or to have their own insurance
cover.</p>

<h2>Entry details</h2>

<p>Participants can take part in one, two or, for those who are so
minded, all three of the distances.</p>

<p>It is suggested that each participant donates a flat rate of £20
for the session, irrespective of which distance is, or distances
are, to be swum given that the purpose of the session is not merely
to train and have a bit of fun, but also to raise money for
Lauren's Silver Swimmers. All those who are participating are
encouraged to raise any money that they can by sponsorship. We hope
to provide details of a Justgiving page in the near future.
Alternatively you can use the old-fashioned hard copy <a
href="/media/32007/5-3-1%20sponsorship%20forms.docx">sponsorship
pledge form</a>.</p>

<li>Complete the <a
href="/media/32013/MSTC 5-3-1 entry form .docx">5-3-1 entry
form</a>&nbsp;and bring it with you to the event.</li>

<li><strong>Please also <a href="mailto:emaj1@mac.com">email Mark
Jordan</a> to inform him which distances you will be taking part
in.&nbsp;</strong></li>

<p>The manager of the activity centre at the reservoir has very
kindly agreed to set up a special course for the session and to
ensure that there will be no other water users in this part of the
reservoir during the session.</p>

<p><a href="/media/32001/5%203%201%20swim%20course.pdf">The 5-3-1
course is shown on this map</a>. It is a 1 km loop set in the south
eastern part of the reservoir. Quite obviously, those swimming 5 km
will complete 5 loops of the course; those swimming 3 km will swim
3 loops of the course, and those swimming 1 km, a single loop. To
assist with counting the laps, a marshal sitting on a canoe will
give swimmers in the 5km and 3km a plastic band at the completion
of each lap.</p>

<p>Parking is available at the reservoir. There is a café at the
Activity Centre. Toilets and a limited amount of changing
facilities are also available at the Activity Centre.</p>

<p>We have a tremendous facility here, in a superb setting, so
please be respectful of the venue, the staff who work there, the
surrounding area and residents.</p>

<p><strong>COMPETITION SCORING</strong></p>

<p>There are 3 competitions for those that are interested. I have
to emphasize that the first point of the BAR races is to find
reasonably local races over various disciplines and distances that
any club members can enter - knowing that many others from our club
will also be competing. Ability is totally irrelevant !! Being part
of something is paramount and getting support, enthusiasm and
camaraderie from other club members by sharing the pleasure of our
sport totally overrides the competitive side of things.</p>

<p>Competition gives you an idea of how far you have come. Does
that training programme work for you? How do you compare against
others?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SHORT BAR (Best All Rounder)</strong></p>

<p>There are 6 Short BAR races, see above. The fastest MSTC man and
lady get 10 points, 2nd fastest 9 points, 3rd - 8 points etc. If
more than 10 compete then every competitor gets 1 point once the
first 9 have been awarded.</p>

<p>In this competition all the 6 races count - and the winners are
the male and female athletes with the highest cumulative scores. In
the past the winners have tended to be the most consistent
athletes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>LONGBAR (Best All Rounder)</strong></p>

<p>There are 6 Long BAR races, see above. The fastest MSTC man and
lady get 10 points, 2nd fastest 9 points, 3rd - 8 points etc. If
more than 10 compete then every competitor gets 1 point once the
first 9 have been awarded.</p>

<p>In this competition all the 6 races count - and the winners are
the male and female athletes with the highest cumulative scores. In
the past the winners have tended to be the most consistent
athletes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BEST ATHLETE</strong></p>

<p>From the 12 BAR races your BEST FOUR count. BUT at least 2 of
the counting races must be multisport (Duathlon or Triathlon - or
Aquathlon if we decide to put one in). The other 2 races can be
any, including other multisport races, but cannot be 2 time trials,
2 runs or 2 swims. The idea is that this prevents a 'super cyclist'
or 'super swimmer' or 'super runner' from dominating the Best
Athlete competition with his/her own specialist sport.</p>

<p>The scoring in these 4 counting races is based on the percentage
above the overall race winner's time. (I count men and women's
winners separately). I then calculate the average percentage for
that athlete - and the athlete who completes 4 scoring race with
the lowest average percentage is the winner.</p>

<p>If you have seen any of our results in recent years you will see
I am always recording that percentage for every competitor. At the
end of the season I calculate the 'BEST SCORE' for every athlete
and record how many 'counting races they took part in. (And, YES,
it does take hours to work it all out!!)</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p class="standard-text"><strong>What I should be wearing for the
event, tips for the beginner?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Swim</strong><br />
 Swimming costume or tri suit<br />
 Swim cap if required<br />
 Goggles</p>

<p><strong>Bike<br />
</strong> A bike - in good working order<br />
 Helmet (no helmet = no race)<br />
 Clothing for the bike or tri suit<br />
 Drink for bike</p>

<p>Extras...<br />
 Cycling shoes for use with clipless pedals.</p>

<p><strong>Run</strong><br />
 Running shoes&nbsp;<br />
 Clothing for the run or tri suit.</p>

<p><strong>Extras...<br />
</strong> Tri suit. A suit which you can use for all elements of
the race so you don't have to get changed. It can be used for the
swim and has a bit of padding in the seat for the bike.<br />
<br />
 Race belt for number (or just safety pin it to your tshirt)<br />
 Towel<br />
 A smile</p>

<p>If you have a trisuit, wear that for the entire event. If you
don't have one or don't want to fork out for one on your first tri,
just wear a swimsuit in the event, then pop on some lycra shorts
and a cycle/running top in transition.</p>

<p>You could wear cycle shorts if you tend to get a bit
uncomfortable on the bike, but remember they aren't the best to run
in so change to running shorts in the second transition.</p>

<p>I would get some tri shorts for your first one as you will
always use them in the future to run in or swim in. Most women
prefer to wear a bra - which means you will need to swim in your
bra. This works fine.</p>

<p>If you are on a mountain bike get some slick road tyres for it
as that will make a big difference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="pageSubtitle"><span>Training</span></p>

<p>Make sure you do some training!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pageSubtitle">Timing</span></p>

<p>You are timed from the moment the starter tells you to go in the
pool until you cross the finish line. The change from pool to bike
is known as T1 (transition 1), this time is included in your swim
time. The bike to run change is T2 (transition 2) and is included
in your run time.</p>

<p class="pageSubtitle">Course familiarisation day</p>

<p>On Saturday May 24th we'll take you out for a guided tour of the
courses <a
href="/the-mid-sussex-triathlon/race-info/course-familiarisation-day.aspx"
 target="_blank" title="course familiarisation">more details
here&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class="pageSubtitle">Registration</p>

<p>Registration&nbsp;takes place on the <strong>SATURDAY
EVENING</strong>&nbsp;before the race from 17:00 until 18:30.&nbsp;
It will be in the Leisure Centre car-park by the entrance to the
tennis courts (the swim in/bike out area). We strongly recommend
you register at this time.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Triangle Leisure Centre<br />
 Jane Murray Way (A273)<br />
 Burgess Hill<br />
 RH15 8WA</p>

<p>Registration will also be open on the <strong>morning of the
race</strong> in the Leisure Centre foyer between 06:00 and
06:45am. There is plenty of free parking. Please note, the
transition area will be closed off at 06.50am so please give
yourself plenty of time to rack the bike and sort out kit and allow
for numerous toilet breaks!! You will need to be pool side at least
5mins before your start time.</p>

<p>Registration will be split into four sections based on your race
number. There will be a number of start list sheets listed
alphabetically so that you can look up your number, a list is also
<a
href="/the-mid-sussex-triathlon/race-entry/race-numbers-and-time-slot.aspx"
 title="Race numbers">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You will need to sign the
registration sheet and leave an emergency contact number</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you have a valid BTF licence you
need to show it at registration. If you don't have it then you will
have to pay £3 for a licence. If you register on Saturday but don't
have it you still have to pay £3 but can get a refund Sunday when
you bring it.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you don't have a BTF licence we
need to give you a day licence (the extra £3 entry fee paid for
this).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you have registered as non-BTF
but subsequently joined we can refund you £3 but you will need to
show your licence.</p>

<p>You will also receive:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2 race numbers.&nbsp; 1 is to be
displayed on your back whilst cycling and the other on your front
whilst running.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bike and Helmet number stickers with
one spare</p>

<p>Please look out for body markers by the registration and
transition areas, your race number will be written in indelible ink
on your left leg and hand.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 On race day competitors should go to the transition area, with
your bike and helmet numbers attached. You will then rack your bike
and lay out kit etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please be aware of competitors who have already started and keep
clear of swim exit route. Toilets, changing rooms and lockers are
adjacent to the pool - lockers take £1 coins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content_title pageSubtitle">Race Briefing</p>

<p class="mst_content">Please ensure that you allow sufficient time
for you to attend the <strong>compulsory race briefing at
06:45.</strong>&nbsp; This will be held just outside the transition
area (the Swim in/Bike out area). All important safety notices and
any course amendments will be explained at the briefing.</p>

<p class="mst_content">The Race Director will give the
briefings.&nbsp; Please feel free to ask him any questions.</p>

<p class="mst_content">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content pageSubtitle">General Race Rules:</p>

<p class="mst_content">The use of MP3 players or mobiles whilst
racing is prohibited as are tumble turns. You will be penalized for
using either.</p>

<p class="mst_content">Any competitor, (including their family or
friends) abusing our marshals or fellow competitors will be
immediately disqualified.</p>

<p class="mst_content">Only competitors and officials are allowed
within the fenced transition areas. You must show your race number
to gain access to and exit from transition.</p>

<p class="mst_content">All competitors should comply with the race
etiquette. This includes allowing faster swimmers to pass. Marshals
will show a 'give way' sign to any swimmers who are causing an
obstruction.&nbsp; Swimmers must comply with the marshal's
instruction. Please read the <a href="/{localLink:1284}"
target="_blank" title="Swim Etiquette the unspoken rules">swim
etiquette section</a> to avoid any confusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content">Please remember to be courteous to the
marshals.&nbsp; They are all fellow triathletes who are officiating
voluntarily.</p>

<p class="mst_content">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content pageSubtitle">Cycling Safety Notice</p>

<p class="mst_content">BTF race rules require that a cycle helmet
is worn for the duration of the cycling discipline.&nbsp; The
helmet must be put on BEFORE you take your bike from the rack in
the swim-cycle transition and it can only be removed once the bike
has been racked in the cycle-run transition.</p>

<p class="mst_content">Cycles must not be ridden in the transition
areas.&nbsp; Cycles must be mounted and dismounted within the
designated areas immediately outside the transition zone.&nbsp;
Listen to the marshal's advice they are there to help and advise
you.</p>

<p class="mst_content">You must be aware that all of the roads will
be open to normal traffic flows.&nbsp; You must comply with the
Highway Code. Cycle on the LEFT and if you are overtaking a slower
rider pull in once you are past.</p>

<p class="mst_content">Remember that you will NOT have priority at
junctions and, therefore, comply with all normal traffic signs and
especially 'Give Way' and 'Stop' signs.&nbsp; Please be especially
aware of horses and riders if you do encounter them please make
them aware of your presence by shouting ahead "Rider on the right"
slow down and give a wide berth.</p>

<p class="mst_content">Any cyclist who is reported by marshals;
officials; police; other road users; competitors or spectators for
riding dangerously or without due care will be disqualified without
recourse to an appeal.&nbsp; Dangerous riding includes (but is not
limited to) riding in the centre or to the right side of a road,
cutting across the centre white line at a junction and failing to
obey a marshal's instruction.</p>

<p class="mst_content">This event does not allow drafting. There
will be a number of static and motorcycle borne marshals monitoring
the cycle course.&nbsp; Any infringement of the drafting rules will
result in a <strong>minimum</strong> 3 minute time penalty and may
result in disqualification.</p>

<p class="mst_content"><br />
 The drafting rules allow 30 seconds for a rider to over take a
slower rider.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the overtaken
cyclist to drop back and maintain the gap once the faster rider has
his or her wheel in front of yours.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content pageSubtitle">Run Course</p>

<p class="mst_content">Competitors do not have right of way on the
run course.&nbsp; The route includes sections on footpaths.&nbsp;
Please watch out for pedestrians and other road users.&nbsp;
Remember to give horse riders a wide berth and when approaching
from behind, let them know you are there!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content pageSubtitle">Aid Stations</p>

<p class="mst_content">There are NO aid/fuel station on the bike
route and one aid station, supplying water at 2.5km on the run
section. Competitors are therefore advised to carry their own drink
bottles/gels etc.</p>

<p class="mst_content">If you are unable to carry empty bottles or
bar/gel wrappers back to transition please drop them with a marshal
so we can clear up afterwards.&nbsp; PLEASE RESPECT THE
ENVIRONMENT.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mst_content"><span class="pageSubtitle">Medical
Notes</span></p>

<p class="mst_content">On race day medical cover will be
provided.&nbsp; An ambulance will be based at the Leisure centre
and ready to respond to any incident whether within the grounds or
on the cycle/run routes.<br />
 It is your own responsibility to ensure that you are fit and able
to take part in the event. Please record an "In Case of Emergency"
number on the reverse of your race number. If you need assistance
please alert a marshal.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" class="mst_content"><em><strong>If you
normally take medication or have a medical
condition.</strong></em><br />
 Many entrants do have a history of medical problems or will be
taking medications or use inhalers.&nbsp; This information is
invaluable to the medical support staff in the unlikely event of an
emergency or if you collapse.&nbsp; For example, knowing that you
are a diabetic or asthmatic can speed the diagnosis and treatment
of your problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" class="mst_content"><br />
 <em><strong>Please enter your medical details on the reverse of
your race number. If you do not, it may prolong the time taken to
give you the appropriate treatment.</strong></em><br />

<p>Can I just say well done and thank you for putting on a great
event on Sunday. I have done the event several times before and it
has always been well run but on this occasion I was completely
struck by how friendly and good spirited the whole event was.
Helped by the sunshine of course, I thought the briefing set the
tone for the event as fun, relaxed and friendly and everyone
including all the competitors just went with it . So well done and
thanks for all your efforts to get so many give always. It made the
prize giving fun for everyone. Moyra</p>

<p>Hi I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you and your club
for a really enjoyable day on sun. The pre day was great giving me
a chance to ask my hundreds of questions. &nbsp;I arrived Sunday
morning a bundle of nerves as this was my first ever one. Your
enjoyable race brief settled them a little bit. Then a very kind
fellow competitor who saw I was a new be walked in to the swim with
me giving me some words &nbsp;of encouragement. &nbsp;While out on
both the bike and run course the marshals were great. It really
encouraged me when I heard them call my name. The other competitors
were so friendly while out on the course shouting encouragement as
they came past. The beer at the finish line was a fab idea and I
enjoyed sitting in &nbsp;the sunshine drinking it listening to the
band. Overall an amazing experience and definitely one I hope to
repeat next year. Mission now is to save up for a bike of my
own.</p>

<p>Hi Steve, Thanks for your email, we did stay around for the
presentation and found the whole day really we'll run and everyone
was really encouraging to us first timers. I have even managed to
get three more friends to do it next year along with myself. Anyway
I've got a 100 mile sportive to focus on in the mean time !!</p>

<p>Thanks again. Nathan</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Steve and Team, Just a few things: first of all, brilliant
race on Sunday. Amazed to see people getting married and having
their birthdays all celebrated by us lot! Top stuff. Very funny
(yet professional) briefing and award ceremony too. Great
marshalling throughout, great course, top event! Thank you.
Eric</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Would like to say thank you so much for the great organisation
and support you gave me yesterday.</p>

<p>Thank you Ruth</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve This was my first Tri with you and won't be my last! I
was extremely impressed with how well it was organised and how
friendly you all were.</p>

<p>Regards Simon</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fantastic event will defo be coming back for more!&nbsp;
Thanks&nbsp;<br />
 Kind regards Leo&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve Thanks for a great race! And thanks to the marshall who
recovered my bike show which flew off as i unclipped coming round
the roundabout for T2!!! Cheers</p>

<p>This was the first tri I did last year and I loved it. This year
i brought two newbies with me and they'll both be back to I reckon.
Managed to knock 6.5 mins off last years time but ended up 10
places lower - so the quality of the field must have been better on
average overall!</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks again Steve</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi - just a quick note to say how brilliant Sunday was - superb
organization, course was great, sun was shining. Perfect
conditions. My only suggestion for next time: get some sports
massage guys along. I really like a massage after a Tri (left calf
muscles!) and was hoping you'd have something available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>See you next year, Jonathan &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve, Just wanted to say THANKS again for the lovely race on
Sunday. Just what I needed. I've written a little race report. Hope
you enjoy it:<br />

<p>Dear Steve Many thanks to you and your colleagues for all the
hard work in arranging the Mid Sussex Triathlon, not only on the
day but in all the build up as well, including the very useful
familiarisation day.&nbsp; I thoroughly enjoyed my first go at a
triathlon, although it was only an Aquabike due to dodgy
knees!&nbsp; I competed with my son, Jonathan,&nbsp;who came second
and we would love to have another go next year when I'll be 60 and,
all being well, my other son will be able to join us after a long
illness - he was chief supporter yesterday and my main training
partner in pool and on the road!&nbsp; The detailed results
service, excellent online photos and everything were great - the
cow bell in the goody bag will go with us to Kitzbuhl a week
tomorrow when we go to support Jonathan in the age group European
Sprint Triathlon!</p>

<p>You asked for feedback on positives and negatives.&nbsp; The
only slight negative for me was&nbsp;confusion over where the
Aquabike was supposed to end.&nbsp; The excellent online course
maps indicate that the end was on the way back up the hill towards
the Triangle, on the other side of the road to the school.&nbsp;
This was also what was said in the pre-race briefing, i.e. "go left
at the roundabout opposite the triangle, down past the school,
round the roundabout and then back up the hill to the Triangle" -
once past the finish we could stop!&nbsp; The "Aquabike Finish"
sign was even set up on the Triangle side of the road, although the
wrong way round!&nbsp; However, the finish line on the day was
in&nbsp;the same position but on the school side of the road - so
there was no need for me to whizz down the hill and put in a
"sprint" finish uphill!!&nbsp; Only a minor point but, to be
honest, I think the finish on the Triangle side would be
much&nbsp;better as it would be easier to chat to the finish judges
- who, when I finished, were on the opposite side of a busy road -
and&nbsp;powering up the hill&nbsp;felt like a real race to the
end, rather than a 10 metre whizz from the Triangle roundabout.</p>

<p>Once again, many thanks indeed to you and all the Marshalls and
others for a really great morning for the whole family.</p>

<p>All best wishes, Martin</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Would like to register some feedback regarding Sundays Tri
Swim was well organised and marshalled I thought the swim across
lanes worked very well. The bike ride was scenic and marshalled to
a very high standard Likewise the run.</p>

<p>Overall a superb event and I will definately do it again. My
only criticism would be the goody bag I think a T shirt advertising
the event and perhaps pointing Out that it was part of series would
be good Publicity,free advertising and be practical ( you can never
have Enough t shirts )</p>

<p>Regards Gary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve,&nbsp; I really did enjoy my first Tri yesterday at Mid
Sussex. &nbsp;I come from a running back ground. A fantastic event
with brilliant support &amp; friendly. I went wrong a couple of
times on the bike. Luckily competitors &amp; Marshall's called me
back to let me know. &nbsp; Not sure if possible may be to have
distance markers on the bike course like the run course.? Might
help with people going off course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will defiantly be back next year &amp; will recommend friends
to do it as a first Tri.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks again Bernadette</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve: I enjoyed the event. It was well organised and very
friendly. I thought the tone of your briefing (welcoming novice
entrants) was inspired.</p>

<p>I messed up the bike leg by getting lost (ignored your
instruction not to turn if no marshall and turned up to Blackstone
on a another events signage. Did a 33k loop in the end per my bike
catseye. Stupid man!)</p>

<p>My next event is Chichester is July. The 1st one I did last year
so hopefully wont get lost.</p>

<p>I would certainly come back next year.</p>

<p>Thankyou Regards Peter</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve and the team, I would just like to say thank you for
putting on such a fantastic event.&nbsp; It was my first triathlon
and I've already signed up for my next!&nbsp; The marshal's where
so friendly and kept me in the right direction, the encouragement
from the other competitors/participants really made it a fantastic
experience, and well worth the trip from Newcastle to take
part.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all your hard work, and look forward to next
year.</p>

<p>Paul</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Just wanted to drop an email to let you know that I really
enjoyed the race, fab &amp; friendly marshalls and a really
inclusive prize giving presentation &nbsp;- although I missed out
this year I will be back to claim something next year!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was my 1st ever tri and definately won't be my last (if only
to beat my atrocious swim time - nerves definately got the better
of me!). Obviously I got a little bit lost on the cycle route but
as I wasn't 'competing' yesterday it didn't matter to me too much -
and this will hopefully give me the advantage to reduce my cycle
time by a fair bit for next year when I will be competing to
improve my times</p>

<p>Thanks for all the hard work. Lisa</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve, enjoyed the event today enormously, particularly the
good spirit, the weather and the loner bike even!</p>

<p>Kevin</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve, Thanks so much for making my first triathlon so
enjoyable! To say I was nervous is an understatement but everyone
was so friendly it made it a great morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks again for all your hard work it is much appreciated.</p>

<p>See you next year! Genny</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Steve, superb day, we really enjoyed it. Looking forward
to next year.</p>

<p>Cheers Anthony</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thoroughly enjoyable second time for me - really well organised
and again brilliantly friendly event. Thanks to all involved. I'll
be back next year. Cheers. Mark</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A big thankyou for putting on such a grate event. I realy
enjoyed every minute, this was my first tri event and cant wait to
book up my next.</p>

<p>Sharharry</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Awesome race - thanks! Steve</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for today. Such an amazing event. I can't believe how
friendly everyone was.</p>

<p>Matt</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you so much Steve! I had such a wonderful and really
enjoyed it. This was my first ever triathlon last year and I'm so
happy that I knocked off 9 mins from last years time! I'm almost
positive it was down to the volunteers cheering and general
happiness! It was a brilliant brilliant event!!</p>

<p>Thank you so much, there aren't enough words to tell you how
much I loved it!</p>

<p>Rest up! Aneesha :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks steve I think I enjoyed it!!! Xxx<br />

<p>Hi Steve, We (from the Lanzarote crowd, Joan Palmer, Andy Palmer
and Marion Coughlan) had an amazing day. &nbsp;This is only our
third triathlon and it was brilliant, you are a great guy and made
the day extra special. &nbsp;We most certainly will be back.</p>

<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Joan</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Steve Wow! You did it again! A fantastic event, thank you.
Hurst novices particularly loved it: you managed to allay fears,
get people to laugh and loosen up, were generous Tour de France
style in throwing out gifts (!) and managed to get lovely people to
enter. You've been instrumental in encouraging the first-timers to
now to enter more Triathlons&nbsp; - and persuading those who were
supporting to vow that they will enter next year! Job done!</p>

<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Karen</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve, Thanks for a wonderful day yesterday and to all the
marshals and helpers, we thoroughly enjoyed our first race and glad
we survived.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hi Steve, I would like to say again a huge thank you to yourself
and your fantastic crew. The event year on year gets even more
atmosphere and the cowbells got everyone going. I thank you for
giving us this opportunity to race. Top day, Top freebies, Top
crew.</p>

<p>Cheers Paul</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Todays sprint tri in Burgess Hill was great fun . Unfortunately
i went the wrong way on the bike course and added on 9.5 miles
(about 29 mins). Hahaha , my fault really for not paying enough
attention but i just saw a sign and followed it , before i knew, it
was too late and i just carried on as i knew the way back to the
Triangle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mark</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for another good event, especially the marshals (and the
accommodating guy on the A272 turn who drove me back to base, I'm
awful with names!).&nbsp;</p>

<p>See you next year!</p>

<p class="feedback pageSubtitle">Feedback from 2013</p>

<p>I just wanted to say THANK YOU to everyone who made the Mid
Sussex Triathlon which took place last Sunday possible. It was the
first triathlon that I have ever done and I had unfortunately been
ill the whole week before. But as I was raising money for charity,
I decided to give it a go even if I did it incredibly slowly.
However, despite the wind, I found it a very positive experience
due to the marshals and other competitors who were so encouraging
the whole way round. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who
was thinking of doing a triathlon.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to you all! And to
let you know that I managed to raise over £800 in the process
towards Kiya Survivors, a very worthwhile cause.</p>

<p>Naomi</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just want to email you and say thanks for an excellent
event.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 All your marshals were so helpful and gave great encouragement,
plus it was so well organised you could not get lost.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Especially, i loved your enthusiasm at the awards ceremony, and
wish all events could be like that.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Have downloaded photos which is a great added bonus, and will
definitely do next year, though may have a go at the aquathon as
would make a change competing in an event that you do not have to
run.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Andrew</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a few queries:<br />
 I'd like to swim a sub 5 min 400 but each year I'm hampered by
swimmers in front. Is there any chance you'd let me go first? Or
with a good +/&gt;60sec gap at the back?<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 I'd like to do the Weald series next year. Could I join the club
and still do this?<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Finally, a problem shared by probably the final 30 cyclist on the
course is the the is milling of competitors who've finished.
Swerving around people with a bike on tired legs while they crack
open the beer is quite demoralising. T1 isn't effected by such
problems as competitors have to rack up before the race begins,
which means the transition is for the most part cleared. I
recognise some of the bigger events (ironman) have similar problems
but as this is a sprint tri so it shouldn't be tpo much trouble
asking finisher to wait until the final cyclist has cleared t2. Do
you think this is possible? Alternatively, add a not in the race
etiquette about such stuff if it's already there then may be it
just needs another polite mention at the race briefing.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 I hope my feedback is useful. As suggested you all deserve medals
for the effort and commitment put into the event, both pre-race,
during and post.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 I look forward to next year, when I hope to get a sub 5min
swim!!</p>

<p>Simon</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some great ideas thanks and you are
right about T2 as one of the downfalls is that I never race it so
don't know what it is like from that point of view and it would
really pi55 me off if someone got in the way in T2 especially as
you are screaming through, unfortunately with the amount of novices
we have they don't recognise it and no matter how much shouting my
marshals do you still get some distracted athletes.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The solution is as you say keep it
closed, I may use you as a benchmark as you are always last to go
off so I think an hour after that so open it about 09:45 - 10:00
with stricter controls when a cyclist is incoming.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">re the delayed swim have a word with
the girl who sets you off, we always have a 20 min buffer for the
pool in case we run over so you can just ask her and it won't be a
problem, I will put a mention in the notes for next year,</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">thanks for the feedback it is very
useful and will be acted on<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 MSTC Response&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Thanks for the response. I imagine there is a balance between a
novice and a more competitive event and the trade-off is a few
additional course obstacles. It would be great if T2 were less
crowded but perfectly happy to swerve or scream, which I admit I
did do as I ran up to my racking point and found someone standing
over my kit and preventing me from racking, it was quickly resolved
and the person possibly thought I could've been more patient but I
don't mind.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><br />
 Simon</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many thanks to you and your team of fabulous, friendly marshals
and organisers for a really wonderful morning on Sunday. I had a
wail of a time!</p>

<p>And just to say, many thanks to you for teaching me to put my
chain on without getting off my bike at the route reccie. It popped
off on Twineham Lane and I got it on without a hitch - I was very
proud of myself!</p>

<p>Looking forward to next year!</p>

<p>Sally</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for such an encouraging email ... I am going to book
this week so I have a target in mind.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 I have just done my 5th swim session and over the winter hope to
squeeze at least one session in per week - I really enjoyed it but
could hardly use my arms the next day!<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 I don't cycle at all at the moment and have a women's hybrid
(bigger wheeled variety) with normal peddles that I just use to get
to the park and back with my children in the summer!</p>

<p>I would really like to come over and practise the course nearer
the time - sounds like a great idea and a great way to meet some
more experienced triathletes to get some guidance.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 It is a very daunting challenge but your advice has been great -
thank you very much.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Emma</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for all your time and support leading up to
yesterday's event.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 What a great event you and your team put on - I had a fabulous
time!<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Please would you pass on my thanks to everyone concerned - without
exception every marshal/official was encouraging and kind. I was
very nervous both at registration and before the event and there
was always someone on hand to answer my questions or give me some
advice. On all sections of the course the marshalls were effective
and supportive, so I felt safe and the encouragement is such a
boost when you are out there trying your best.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The tone was set right from the start during race briefing - we
all knew what to do and wanted to work together so everyone could
enjoy it.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 A great venue - stress free parking and ample changing facilities
(certainly beats trying to change in the car as I've had to do
before at running events!).<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 All the competitors were really lovely too - great to hear the
cheers as swimmer 1 jumped in and started their race.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 I can't wait to compete again next year and I am so buoyed up by
the experience that I am even considering getting a wetsuit so I
can try longer distance events next year (any advice about where to
buy a wetsuit?!).<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Many thanks again.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Emma</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for giving me a mention for my age group and I'm sorry
that I had to get back for work so I could not be there at the
end.<br />
 Thank you so much for a great event - again!- and I shall
certainly be encouraging all Triathletes I know to enter it next
year :-)<br />
 Best wishes</p>

<p>Karen</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A big thanks for a great event. It was really well organised
with friendly and helpful marshals all the way round. I thoroughly
enjoyed it and will be back. Sophie my wife did herself proud in
the aquabike.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Andy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was caught off guard with intense lower abdominal cramps after
the swim but in honesty I don't think it helped that I didn't&nbsp;
warm up enough before the swim so let that be a lesson for myself
and others in the future!<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 However both the marshals and ambulance staff put me at ease and
within 10 mins the cramps eased and I felt I could continue. I was
so close to packing in it and going home but I just thought no! Ive
got to at least try to finish. It a great event and was so well
organised yet again.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 I didn't catch their names but I am so very grateful to the
marshals who not only checked if I was ok after the swim, but
continued to check on me during the rest of the race, you just
don't get that level of attention in all races that's for sure</p>

<p>thanks for organising such a good event for us - the atmosphere
was just right with good banter and a 'fun' feel.<br />
 The only thing from our side was that the swimmers were set off a
little too close together which did lead to quite a congested swim
at times.<br />
 Dan</p>

<p>Massive thanks for an amazing event.&nbsp; Loved every minute of
it, from the pre-race briefing to the beer at the finish
line!<br />
 Thanks once again,</p>

<p>Steve</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loved the race today - brilliant organisation, friendly and
helpful marshals and a great course! Will definitely be back next
year!<br />
 Kind regards</p>

<p>Hi Steve Well done to you and your team for a fun morning of
racing. We loved the buzz and the atmosphere as normal. My cousin
Deborah came down from Kent along with a few friends on my
recommendation and they all loved the day. My wife Claire who took
part in her 1st sprint and enjoyed it all. Well done and see you in
2014.<br />
 Regards</p>

<p>Generally, a very good triathlon. It was my first complete
triathlon and I thought it went very well, and that's down to the
superb team of marshals. Perhaps I may offer a suggestion in
regards to the lay out of the swim section, due to the build up
caused by slower swimmers. Firstly, it would definitely help if the
starting marshal ensures that a gap of 15 seconds is maintained
throughout, as in most cases the gap was closer to 7 seconds and
this led to an early catch up to the swimmer in front (due to the
faster swimmers starting after the slower swimmers). Another point
of suggestion is that perhaps there could be a way to start the
faster swimmers first? I was towards the end of the second wave
(SJB), and for the whole second half of the swim I was stuck in a
big build up. (Although I do understand this would lead to
complications and potentially a delay of the whole event.. which is
why I assume this is the current layout?) - there were 16 of us
going in a single direction in the same lane... which obviously
added on a lot of valuable time!!! However, a MASSIVE thanks for
all the effort put in, it was very evident, and as I said, it was
well marshaled all of whom were very friendly! A massive
thanks!</p>

<p>Just wanted to say what a great event today was. Good routes,
great organisation, great atmosphere. Thoroughly enjoyed it ( well
perhaps not all the way to end of the run!)<br />
 Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi crew Just a quick note to you all for a great triathlon it
was my first of many, you have a good team and I thank you for all
your hard work.<br />

<p>Thanks to all the organisers and marshalls at this mornings

 What a great race today, we had a an absolute blinder and enjoyed
the route, support and everything else. I don't think between
Caitlin and I we can think of anything that would improve the race.
A couple of bumpy roads but that is to be expected in Southern
England.<br />
 Jake</p>

<p>Thanks for running such a friendly and well organised event
today. The marshals were so encouraging and friendly, going out of
their way to check race numbers and give some personal words of
encouragement! I'll definitely be signing up for next year...I've
got to improve in my fairly dismal bike time! Thanks again to all
who helped out today.<br />
 Fiona</p>

<p>hello guys, I Just wanted to congratulate you on an
exceptionally well organised event again today, that just seems to
get better and better each year. This is my 3rd year of doing this
event, and definitely one of my favourites. Two of my club members
entering for the first time also agreed to, and want to do again
next year. The generosity in prizes for all entrants just topped it
off this year as the best year ever. Well done to all! The change
in swim direction however was a surprise though, but I understand
that this was a health and safety reason due to the ropes / red
markers<br />
 Dave</p>

<p>Just a quickie to say thanks to all involved for such a good
event.<br />
 As you know, it was my first ever triathlon, and I didn't set any
records&nbsp; but enjoyed the whole thing and the support your
marshalls offered.<br />
 I didn't come last though... and maybe next time I can move up a
page on the results!!<br />
 Paul</p>

<p><br />
 To Steve and all at MSTC. I took part in the event this morning
and would like to pass on my thanks to all of you who pulled off a
great race, very slick organisation and super-cheery/encouraging
marshals ( many of whom I know from being part of the club some
years ago). My swim time needed to be amended (due to a shoulder
injury from moshing!...and a little less training than may have
been prudent) and it made such good sense to be able to to adjust
my swim position with no fuss. I had thought yesterday when I
registered that it would save some queueing to be marked up at the
same time but I appreciate the thorough security before being
allowed into transition and the marshals whipped through the queue
this morning in no time. If you ask around the club, you will hear
time and again that I struggled and cursed through many triathlons
between 2000 and 2002 but I actually enjoyed it today! Already
looking forward to next year. Thank you again.<br />
 Fi Pugh.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone involved in today's race, another
successful event with great support from the marshals, which is
much appreciated. I didn't look in the goody bag until I got home,
but love the mug and medal with the Jubilee theme. 10/10 for
originality! See you again in 2013.<br />
 Karen</p>

<p><br />
 The triathlon today was fantastic! Only my second ever but
definitely the best! Well organised. Brilliant marshalls - helpful
and so supportive. I liked the way the swim was organised. Bike
route not too scary and run was great for me - a new PB for 5k and
a new PB for the triathlon. Beautiful medal and the best goody bag
I've ever had at any event! I can see I'm going to end up doing
another triathlon. Thanks to everyone at MSTC.<br />
 Helen</p>

<p><br />
 Just a note to say thanks very much to you and your team of great
marshals and volunteers at yesterday's Mid Sussex Tri. As well as
their ability to point people in the right direction, and keep
things running smoothly, I was especially impressed with those
positioned on the run that were able to specifically find out our
names as we approached them and went past and shout encouragement.
A relatively small touch, but meant a lot and keep me going that
extra little bit!</p>

<p>I presume it was yourself that spoke at the race briefing about
feedback, and, for the record, I would certainly recommend the
event to others and hope to return next year. I can't really think
of any improvements that could be made, especially as I would
imagine that putting something like that together is no mean feat
in the slightest!</p>

<p>well done again to you all, and thanks for the Goodie bag
too.<br />
 John</p>

<p>Good morning Steve A big thanks to all of the organisers and
helpers who made yesterdays event such a success. It was my first
Triathlon and although I wasn't exactly fast I loved every minute
of it. Having lost 4 stone in the last year after not exercising
since I left school (30 years ago) - I can tell you it felt
fantastic crossing that line and the encouragement all the way
around was a real boost. Bring on the next one!!!!!<br />
 Kevin</p>

<p>I took part in yesterday's triathlon, and wanted very much to
thank all of those involved for taking the fear away, and making it
such a tremendously enjoyable experience. I am surprised that we
needed to be told to be polite to the marshals, as they were,
without exception, so benevolent, patient with questions, and
encouraging. It shocks me that, to warrant such caution, past
competitors must have been rude to them. As a classical musician I
am very new to sport, and am only now beginning to see the appeal!
The camaraderie during the cycle, when the (vast numbers of)
cyclists overtook me and cheered me on was hugely encouraging.
Whilst I am used to stage performances, this was a whole new and
wonderful thrill. I am so grateful to you all who gave of your time
and organised it so immaculately.<br />
 Siobhain</p>

<p>What a wonderful day!&nbsp; I didn't know it was actually
possible to ENJOY a triathlon!&nbsp; Even the run bit!&nbsp; OK,
maybe I didn't enjoy absolutely all of the run<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Thanks so much for all your words of encouragement, advice and
support.&nbsp; And thanks to everyone else who helped out -
including Kay for the hug and support, and all the other marshalls
for being so lovely and voting me the fourth best smiler in the
competition.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever won anything at a
'sports day' before!<br />
 Issa</p>

<p>Thanks to all the organisers and marshalls at this mornings
triathlon. My husband David and I loved it.We think it is the
friendliest triathlon We have been to.<br />
 Jennie</p>

<p>Just thought drop you a line, thought the event yesterday was
really well organised and the marshals were all very cheerful and
helpful, this was my first tri, and i'm sure it'll be an event that
i'll do again. There was a great atmosphere on the day and a good
sense of camaraderie between competitors. Thanks for a great day -
be great to see chip timing next year!<br />
 David&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just to say thank you for a great event on Sunday. Hurst loved
it! Fab family day and I hope to recruit more for next year. All
credit to your organisation, the really helpful Marshalls and the
general spirit of the day.<br />
 Thank you for the 'Spirit of Tri' prize awarded to Tim Leeper - it
really made his first Tri special :-)<br />
 Karen</p>

<p>Just a note to thank you and your team for putting on such an
excellent event yesterday.</p>

<p>As a triathlon first-timer I was a wee bit apprehensive
beforehand, but felt like I was in safe hands from the moment I
arrived at the Leisure Centre. I spoke with a number of stewards at
different times and every one of them was genuinely friendly,
helpful, well-organised and not the least bit bossy or
officious.</p>

<p>I was particularly grateful to the steward who offered me some
unsolicited advice when I discovered that my legs had turned to
jelly on dismounting the bike - "Take short strides for the first
kilometre" - he turned out to be exactly right. Sure enough
normal-ish motor control of my pins resumed at about the 1km
mark.</p>

<p>Obviously events like yesterday's don't organise themselves, and
you and your team must have done a great deal of hard work to make
sure that every detail had been taken care of. You did a brilliant
job - thank you very much indeed.</p>

<p>Tom</p>

<p><br />
 Thank you and your team sooo much for Sunday. I had a great day
thanks to your lovely marshalls, the fact it did not rain, rock
tape and beating my last years time by a good 8 minutes! Oh and it
may have been more than 8 mins if my 3 year old had not insisted in
running the last 200m with me!! Seriously it was a fab day, thank
you, Becky ;0)</p>

<p>Hi... Thought Id drop a bit of feedback in on the Traithlon.
What a great event. Was only my second triathlon and I was really
impressed with every aspect of the day. Registration easy,
transition area very secure, marshalling excellent, organisation
overall was spot on. I am a member of Portsmouth Triathletes and I
have had really good comments on the finishers medal and the mug...
really nice touches. Thanks again and I look forward to another
event soon. Please congratulate all of your team as they have done
a super job.<br />

 Hi MSTC, Just would like to say what a wonderful experience i had

to all the helpers. Excellent . I was made to feel welcome and park

i was to join the MSTC id not be allowed to entry next year? Many

 Fantastic race, was only my 2nd triathlon but thoroughly enjoyed
it! Was very well organised, great help and direction from
marshalls/ officials. Very impressed with the whole morning, will
definitly do this event again next year! James<br />
<br />
 Dear Steve Just wanted to thank you for a fantastic race, only my
second one but certainly the most enjoyable so far. Will definitely
come again next year. Many thanks Richard<br />
<br />
 Hi steve , i allways enjoy this race, must be my 6th year now of
competing . Two things i would really like to see included for
future races , no.1 , chip timing , its unusual now to go to a race
without it. The other bit is even easier, when giving out the
trophies use the BTF 5-year age groups to select the winners,
40-49, 50-59 doesnt really work, we all deteriorate after 40 and 9
years is too much to bridge unless you are really an exceptional
athlete. Most events dont include the top 3 in the category awards
either so the spread of trophies goes even further. see you next
year, Mike &nbsp; Note: Considering the AG issue next year<br />
<br />
 Can you pass on a big thank you to all of the Mid Sussex Tri
members marshalls for a great well run race. See you next year have
a great race season all the best Steve</p>

<p>Thank you for organising such a fabulous event! It was my first
ever tri, and I loved it! All the marshalls and event organisers
were really friendly and helpful, and there was a great atmosphere.
I've got 'The Bug' now... I'm looking for the next one to enter!
Thank you! Laura</p>

<p>This was my 2nd tri and it was a really lovely day, even the
weather could not spoil it for me. The course was beautiful and the
marshals were fantastic and made the whole experience great. I have
been to watch some Tri's run by other company's and the marshals
were really rude so what a joy this was. I am still learning when
it comes to the sport but know for sure that i will be back next
year. Thank you all so much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lesley</p>

<p><br />
 FANTASTIC! great job! absolutely brilliant! all marshalls were
encouraging, it was an easily followed course i had advise and
encouragement from marshalls along the way &amp; at transitions
Thank you And i raised £720 for First touch charity so a double
bonus :-) Jody<br />
<br />
 Thank-you once again MST, my 4th (i think) time at your event and
I can only say I love this race. Nice crowd, easy registration,
well marshalled, good course, excellent goody bag - 5* all day
long! Downside - transition a bit hit and miss but hey you're doing
a great job. See you in 2012. &nbsp; Martin</p>

<p class="feedback">I have just completed the tri today and have
competed in triathlon for the last 18 years. I just wanted to say
that the marshalls at the mid sussex tri are probably the best I
have come across. They are always cheerful, helpful and responsive.
I have done the mid sussex tri on many occasions and the quality of
the marshalling never drops. Please pass this on to them. See you
next year. Colin</p>

<p class="feedback"><br />
 Great, thanks for that. It was again a great event, very well run
and enjoyable to do. &nbsp;Will be back again next year. &nbsp;A
suggestion, for future - perhaps also post results in a csv format
so can be opened in excel. &nbsp;I'm the kind of geek that likes
doing all sorts of sorting and filtering to compare myself with
others...! &nbsp;Barry &nbsp; &nbsp;Note: We have now done this
Steve<br />
<br />
 Thanks to everyone at Mid-Sussex for another great race. The
Guides were brilliant, calling out our names and cheering us on.
Although injured, I beat my husband but just missed beating my
friend to 1st in my age-group! Swim worked better this year with
more people giving way when getting their feet tapped. Changed bike
route was OK, just one issue with a novice competitor undertaking
me on the 2nd round-about, he apologised when I shouted at him. A
few people drafting so hope the draft buster caught them! Love the
medal, shame it says miles for the bike! Thanks again. Hope to see
you again in 2012 injury free. Karen &nbsp; &nbsp;Note: ooops<br />
<br />
 This was my 1st triathlon. It was a fabulous initiation into the
world of yet another kind of challenge to me. Made me do some
onward thinking as I puffed round the bike route! The courses were
excellently signed and the marshals wonderfully cheery. Would
certainly recommend this event to others. Now to go and work on my
swim times. Jackie<br />
<br />
 Big thanks to all the marshalls who ga e up their time. Good job
the weather kept off. I will be back next year.thanks. Martin<br />

<p class="feedback">Just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone

I've been a runner for years but this was my first Tri and I'm

instructions and route markers, very friendly and supportive staff.
It was a really great experience and an event I'd recommend without
hesitation; please pass my thanks on to everyone involved. I'm very
interested in joining the club as I'm local (Newick) - grateful if
you could let me know how I go about that too. Thanks again.

 I just want to say a big thank you to you and all your helpers as
everything went very smoothly today. Your mashalls were all very
friendly and encouraging which helped drag a reluctant smile from
this struggling athlete! And you did well to keep the rain away
until later... Thanks again, Gill<br />
<br />
 Great event. Well run by very friendly and encouraging people.
Loved the previous night registration. Actually preferred this
year's cycle route over last year's. Could have been body marked at
registration to prevent the queue. Application form asked for 500m
swim time not 400m, I found I was amongst slower swimmers and
probably annoyed many by heel tapping as I put down my 500m swim
time. But thanks for a great event. Gethyn<br />
<br />
 Steve, Another quality event (my 2nd year) and really impressed by
your team of Marshals and organisation. Race didn't go to plan for
me as I picked up a flat in T1 but once on the go I found the bike
route enjoyable and if I'm honest prefer it to last years. Cheers
again &amp; the box of gels etc will come in useful for my next
event. Alan<br />
<br />
 Thanks. Excellent race. Well organised and very well marshalled.
Suggestions for improvements: 1) chip timing. I'd like to know my
T1 &amp; T2 times. 2) stricter control of swim timing and number
order in the pool. 3) bike racks are too low for some bikes (mine).
But generally really good and i'm looking forward to next year
already. &nbsp;John<br />
<br />
 I competed in the mid sussex tri today and I would like to thank
everyone who helped to run it, its a tedious job being a marshal
but your marshals were fantastic! encouraging, helpful, efficient
and lots of them! impossible to go the wrong way! A fantastic venue
with amazing facilities. I will definately be back next year!
&nbsp;Rachel<br />
<br />
 The zig / zag swim format is now very outdated and impacts swim
times. I am not the greatest swimmer but found this an unnecessary
additional complication. You have got to get chip timing I finished
17th and my training partner Noel second and neither of us had bike
or run splits, recovering from 120th after my swim I was
partcularly keen to see my run split which I was pleased with.
Thanks, Simon (East Grinstead Tri Club). Otherwise a well organised
and friendly race which I enjoyed. PS having cycled the old cycle
route the switch to Hurstpierpoint should be considered as a
permanent switch. Simon &nbsp; Note: Simon now has his splits<br />
<br />
 Just to say big thanks for a great event and you must have 'the
best' marshalls - I thought is was good that all the competitors
applauded the marshalls at the briefing and rightly so!!!!. i.e no
marshalls no event - All good even with a slight route change so
look forward to next years event - I can now retire as I have
finally won something ok it was a number prize but I will put the
Hi5 race pack to good use :-) Cheers Graham<br />
<br />
 Steve, Great event very well organised. To improve: At the start
of the swim people were not lined up in number order. I difrent
numbers go in just before me. Consequently, I had to overtake at
least 5 people in the lanes. Could someone supervise the swim line
up? Could we start at 15 or 20 second intervals, it got quite
crowded? Alternatively do a 500m swim in lanes, say 4 to a lane,
one out one in? Don't get me wrong, I am not moaning just a couple
of things to consider. Thank you for a great event. Keith<br />
<br />
 Great organized race, so congrats. Nice to have spot prizes and
also age group etc (not tight in giving out prizes unlike other
money making events...). Only a few "minor" comments; run : Would
be better if the marshalls can stand on corner of section you need
to run around. I.e when running you normally run towards marshall.
(area around housing estate and main road after). Tranisition;
Would prefer to have timing on transitions as it is nice to compare
(dork out) these parts as well.. Seem to be a bit more hanging
around. I.e for later starters in the pool. Too tired to think to
what I can recomend, but "food for thought". Thanks again !!!

 Hi Steve. Just to say thank you very much for a superbly organised
triathlon today. For my part, it &nbsp;was my first (and maybe
last!!) and I &nbsp;felt very welcome and &nbsp;enthused by

fond memories and &nbsp;a sense of &nbsp;achievement from
today.&nbsp;Ian<br />

morning i would like to mention what a really well organised event

triathlon and this felt like an excellent test for my new road bike
and resulted in me wanting to do more events like this. I thought
the marshals did an excellent job of directing everyone around the
course, and i enjoyed the zig-zag swim as it gives you a definitive
start and end point and its more of a journey rather than just
straight laps. many thanks Claire<br />

course change before hand). I even bumped into a school friend that
I had not seen for 25 years. See you next year. Andy</p>

<p class="feedback">"Dear Mid Sussex Tri<br />
 Thanks for a great event today, thoroughly enjoyed it, especially
as I improved form 1.36 2 years ago to around 1.17 - I will know

<p class="feedback">"I just wanted to thank you again for letting
me into yesterday's tri as a late entrant. It's all still pretty
new to me - yours was the 2nd one that I've competed in - and it
was a really enjoyable day, really well organised, with a great
support team, and a great course!! Best of luck to you and the club
for the rest of the season. Btw: I hope that you enjoyed the Jaffa
Cakes:-)"<span class="feedback_name">Matt</span></p>

<p class="feedback">"HI,<br />
 This was the first year of competing and only my third race and
absolutely loved it! The swim was 'different' with the zig-zagging
and true to the rumours the bike course was very undulating! The
run did feel like it went on and on, especially the last bend in to
the Triangle as the marshall said 90 seconds to go - I think he was
lying!! However to cross the line with so many of my fellow
triathlon club members was great! A well planned and organised
event with plenty of encouragement from all the marshalls - a BIG
thanks to them. Also a bonus to get all our piccies from Ant Bliss
FREE! Well done and look forward to seeing you next year!"<span

<p class="feedback">Well organised/ marshalled as usual and the run
course much better than last time I did the event in 2007. There
were a lot of people with VERY inaccurate swim times who then
aggressively overtook in the pool . Perhaps you could emphasize the
importance of an accurate time to avoid this happening. Some of the
poorer/ early swimmer looked very panicked at people swimming over
them and kicking /pushing past. Perhaps some "pool etiquette" for
overtaking could be sent out?<span class="feedback_name">Sue

<p class="feedback">Hi, thanks for putting on a great event, all of
the marshalls were really helpful and friendly and the roads were
immaculately swept. Your arrangements for the weather were also
fantastic and I look forward to next years event. The only down
side was that I finished second in may age group and never made it
to the presentation as it really wasn't expected, this being a
first for me.<span class="feedback_name">Haydn</span></p>

<p class="feedback">"Had a great day - well done. Would it be
possible to split out the T1 and T2 times?"<span

<p class="feedback">"Hi all at mid sussex tri club, just to let you
know the event was very well run i will be back next year .see you
soon"<span class="feedback_name">Steven Ingham East grinstead tri
club</span></p>

<p class="feedback">"Overall I thought it was a well organised and
fantastic event. Particular postives included:<br />
 1. Great supportive and cheery marshalls, it really does make a
difference to have the marshals clap and cheer you on.<br />
 2. Well sign-posted and clear bike route.<br />
 3. Great deal with Ant Bliss on the photographs.<br />
 4. Simple and quick registration.<br />
 The only negatives I have are:<br />
 1. Lack of splits for all disciplines including transitions.<br />
 2. Slightly chaotic start to the swim with people swimming out of
time sync. I got held up in the pool through traffic. Think it
would be good to have someone poolside asking/checking predicted
swim times and ensuring that they go off in the correct order/wave.
I had someone start a few places ahead of me whose time was around
10 minutes yet I'm capable of sub 6 minutes.<br />
 Overall, a great event and I will be back next year so well done

<p class="feedback">"Hi<br />
 Wow! Cool; thanks. I've not had a prize for sports since I was
about 18! I had a really good morning. You were right; all the
marshals and other competitors were really helpful and pointed me
in the right direction. And, the set up seemed to run like
clockwork. Very smooth and efficiently managed. Well done you. I
learned a few lessons (like, bring a spare old t-shirt and a pair
of flip flops.) and not to gun off on the bike as the run is tough!
Thanks for looking after us all so well. You guys did a super job.
Look forward to seeing you next year"<span
class="feedback_name">Jenn</span></p>

<p class="feedback">I loved the race. Agree that the swim was a bit
of a traffic jam but I quite like the zig-zag swim. Must remember
to bring a swim hat next time. I'm so used to being handed one at
races and I've never noticed how difficult it is to swim with a
face full of hair! The race was well organised and marshalled.
Superb weather. Nice to touch to give all competitors a glass
trophy - makes me feel like a winner! Great to have free photos -
would be even better if they offered an airbrushing service to make
me look more athletic!</p>

<p class="feedback">I just wanted to say that I thought this event
was fantastic. The organisation was really good and the marshals
were excellent especially on the bike ride where they seemed to be
everywhere! The venue was very good with lots of parking and
excellent facilities. I sometimes think that triathlons are rather
expensive but after your event I felt happy at the price because I
could see that it must cost a lot to organise."<span

<p class="standard-text eventtype">Just a note to thank you and
your team for putting on such an excellent event yesterday.</p>

<p class="standard-text eventtype">As a triathlon first-timer I was
a wee bit apprehensive beforehand, but felt like I was in safe
hands from the moment I arrived at the Leisure Centre. I spoke with
a number of stewards at different times and every one of them was
genuinely friendly, helpful, well-organised and not the least bit
bossy or officious.</p>

<p class="standard-text eventtype">I was particularly grateful to
the steward who offered me some unsolicited advice when I
discovered that my legs had turned to jelly on dismounting the bike
- "Take short strides for the first kilometre" - he turned out to
be exactly right. Sure enough normal-ish motor control of my pins
resumed at about the 1km mark.</p>

<p class="standard-text eventtype">Obviously events like
yesterday's don't organise themselves, and you and your team must
have done a great deal of hard work to make sure that every detail
had been taken care of. You did a brilliant job - thank you very
much indeed.</p>

<p>Experienced drivers know that roads are safer and more efficient
when everyone observes a few common courtesies and basic rules.
Such things are even more important when there are no explicit
signs or signals to tell everyone what to do.</p>

<p>If you catch the person in front of you and wish to overtake
then the overtaking swimmer should gently but distinctly touch the
feet of the swimmer being overtaken.&nbsp; It may take two or three
touches, but overtaking swimmers should not need to repeatedly slap
or grab at the legs of a slower swimmer to politely make their
presence known.</p>

<p>A lead swimmer who feels a touch on the feet from an overtaking
swimmer, should continue to the next wall, then stop in the corner
of the lane to let faster swimmers past.&nbsp; A single light touch
may be accidental and can be ignored, but two or more distinct
touches should be regarded almost universally as a request to swim
through.</p>

<p>Swimmers enjoying a draft behind a strong lead swimmer, but who
are just barely able to hold that pace should think twice before
tagging the leader's toes and requesting to move ahead.&nbsp; In
such situations, it's highly unlikely that the (formerly) trailing
swimmer will be able to hold the same pace for very long when
leading without the draft.&nbsp; This can lead to repeated
"leap-fogging" and unnecessary contact, which can be annoying and
disruptive for everyone in the lane.</p>

<p>Drafting swimmers not wishing to pass should swim far enough
back from a lead swimmer that they don't inadvertently touch the
lead swimmer's toes.</p>

<p>The swim is a zig zag and you have to go under the lane ropes so
if you can on your turn around dive under rope not stop and get
under this will make for a faster swim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be swim marshals observing and if they deem that you
have not given way when needed and are holding the lane up you will
be shown a Give way sign. You must stop at this point, if you
ignore this you will be penalized by a timing penalty.</p>

will be a 'zig-zag' swim keeping to the left of the lanes, swim two
lengths then change down a lane and so on till you run out of lanes
(total 400m). It would be worth practising diving under the rope
when you turn around as this will be much quicker than stopping and
ducting under it</p>

<p class="mst_content">The first swimmer will start at 7.00am.

          <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p class="pageSubtitle">Aquabike what is it and are there any
pedalos involved.</p>

<p>Aquabike is be the perfect low-impact option for people who
can't, or won't, run so if you are new to multisport events and
think a triathlon is too daunting? Or can't run through injury, or
an aversion of that part of a triathlon? Then why not try an
Aquabike it may be just the challenge you are looking for.</p>

<p>Yes that's right a Swim followed by a cycle. The Aquabike and
Triathlon will start together in the pool and then followed by a
cycle but then unlike the triathletes no running!</p>

<p>The aquabike scene was first introduced in 2005 in the USA as a
pilot programme and proved popular with people who found, that for
whatever reason, running was not suited to them. The sport is still
popular today with events nationwide.</p>

<p>I decided to run this race after an injury stoped me running for
nearly a year. I could swim and cycle ok so still entered races but
had DNF (Did Not Finish) next to my results as i did not go out on
the run. I thought this unfair but found Aquabikes almost non
existant outside of the USA and now hope more events will include
them.</p>

<p>See the <a
href="/the-mid-sussex-triathlon/race-info/race-instructions.aspx"
title="Race Instructions">Race Instructions</a> for information on
what to do on race day and no pedalos as that would be classed as
an unfair advantage.</p>

<p><br />
 <strong>History</strong></p>

<p>Aquabike was created in 2005 as a way to increase participation
in athletes who suffered knee and hip injuries by eliminating the
run portion of the event. Many long course triathlon events
embraced this style of competition by hosting a 1.2 mile swim and
56 mile bike. The multisport world was surprised to find that not
only were athletes with trouble running competing, but so were a
new crop of participants, as this distance allowed<br />
 them the endurance of a long course event without the pounding on
the joints caused by the 13.1 miles (the run portion of long course
triathlons).</p>

<p><strong>Future</strong><br />
 As the median age of BTF members gets older, the organization
anticipates even more participants looking for competitive events
that can help save some of their joints.</p>

<p>My personal vision is that more event organisers will take this
on and make the sport of Aquabike run hand in hand with
Triathalon.</p>

<h2>Equipment Needed?</h2>

<p>You may think that a sport with three different activities will

good news is that this really isn't necessary!</p>

for GoTri! and you may well find that you have most of this in some
shape or form already.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div>Swimsuit/trunks, goggles and a towel</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Roadworthy bicycle and cycle helmet (both must be the correct
fit for the rider)</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Running shoes, shorts and t-shirt</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Water bottle and light snack (e.g. cereal bar)</div>
</li>

</li>

<li>
<div>Warm/waterproof clothing</div>

<li>
